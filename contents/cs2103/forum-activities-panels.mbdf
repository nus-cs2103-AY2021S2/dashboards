Hello,

For the user guide, I understand there were mentions of including only relevant parts of the application in a screenshot (so that they need not be frequently changed with updates). However, on the other hand, the tradeoff is that it is up to the user to identify which part of the application the screenshot is referring to.

That said, if the team feels that the UI is unlikely to receive frequent updates once it has been finalised, would it not be neater to display the entire application to the user (perhaps with annotations) so that at one glance they immediately know which part of the application to look out for? I imagine this saves time for the user and also eliminates room for confusion.

This brings me on to the following point:

<img width="811" alt="Screenshot 2021-03-26 at 4 22 49 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43908963/112603964-a1eb1c80-8e50-11eb-9377-f149782a96ee.png">

If a screenshot of the entire application is used, it will undoubtedly appear repetitive in the sense that there will be the same layout present in every screenshot. However, I am not sure if this would necessarily impair a user's experience, given that unfamiliar users might appreciate having the full picture. After all, the issue seems more to be the ease of maintenance. May I thus clarify if using full screenshots showing the different states/commands of an application will automatically count as a bug?

Thank you in advance!

I am not sure if I have misunderstood any of the above instructions but I am currently confused as to how the milestones should be named for them to be tracked correctly. Specifically, if a weekly iteration approach is taken, should the milestones be named `mid-v1.2` and `v1.2`? Or should they be named `v1.2` and `v1.2b`?

<panel  header="**6. :fas-info-circle: 💡Quick guide to adding checkstyle with gradle**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/93" expanded>

Hello! 

Thought to share a quick guide for the use of `checkstyle` since there has been quite a number of issues surrounding it. Hopefully this also serves as a sort of checklist in case some steps might have been missed out in setting up checkstyle! :)

**Disclaimer: You might want to make a copy of your current project first. These steps worked for me though I have only tested them on MacOS and while I do not believe they will cause issues, it's better to err on the side of caution :3 Additionally,  This quick guide provides the key steps to setting up checkstyle but the full tutorial can be found [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html). Steps are below!**

1. Head over to the root of your project and create the directories as follow:
```
./config/checkstyle/
```
2. Within the newly created `./config/checkstyle/` folder, place both `checkstyle.xml` and `suppressions.xml` files which can be retrieved [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle).
3. Within your `build.gradle` file, ensure checkstyle is included as shown below:
```
plugins {
    // previously added plugins
    id 'checkstyle'
}

checkstyle {
    toolVersion = '8.29'
}
```
4. Reload your project and the following command should work:
```
gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest
```
**Extra:**

The current `checkstyle.xml` file does not check for capitalisation of constant names for private attributes even though the coding standard requires that to be the case. This can be updated in line **107** of `checkstyle.xml` by changing the boolean of the property as shown below:

**Before**
```
<property name="applyToPrivate" value="false"/>
```
**After**
```
<property name="applyToPrivate" value="true"/>
```

Hope this helps :D

Hello!

I would like to highlight the following discrepancies between the checkstyle file and java coding standard:

1) Screaming snake case not enforced for private attributes in checkstyle file.

2) Javadocs header comments not enforced for getters, setters and constructors.

I am under the impression the java coding standard takes precedence over the checkstyle file so it might be best to manually check for the above until the discrepancies are sorted out :D

<panel  header="**8. :fas-info-circle: 💡Creating JAR file if your app uses third-party libraries**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/40" expanded>

Hello!

I struggled a bit creating the JAR file with third-party libraries for tag `A-Jar` as a fat JAR file is needed to solve dependency issues as highlighted in this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jar.html), so I thought to just share some steps that might help anyone else using third-party libraries as well.

**Disclaimer: You might want to make a copy of your current project first. These steps worked for me though I have only tested them on MacOS and while I do not believe they will cause issues, it's better to err on the side of caution :3 Steps are below!**

1) The guide recommends the use of [gradle](https://gradle.org/) for creating a fat JAR file (in fact, peeking into week 4 project would reveal the need to eventually follow scenario 2 of the guide). Under all of our forked repos, there (thankfully) already exist a branch called add-gradle-support. Fetch the branch and track it:
```
git fetch origin add-gradle-support  
git checkout --track origin/add-gradle-support
```
2) Check that the `add-gradle-support` branch exist then switch over to your master and merge the new branch in:
```
git branch
git checkout master
git merge add-gradle-support
```
3) If you do not see a `build.gradle` file now appearing in the root of your project, close and reopen your project then open up the `build.gradle` file. Under `dependencies` section in the file, add your third-party library. For example, using the [json-simple](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.googlecode.json-simple/json-simple/1.1.1) library, the `dependencies` section would look as such (notice the additional first line):
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple:1.1.1'
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.5.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.5.0'
}
```
4) Next, under the `application` section of the file, edit `mainClassName` to match that of your main class (Duke if you have been using that name all the time). If you did the `A-Packages` tag, this will need to match your package name as well. For example, if your java files sit under the package `com.example.app` with the main class Duke, your `mainClassName` in the `build.gradle` file will look as such:
```
application {
    mainClassName = "com.example.app.Duke"
}
```
5) Finally, run the following command in the root of your project on the terminal:
```
./gradlew shadowJar
```
6) From the root of your project directory, you will find the new JAR file within the `./build/libs` folder which you can then run with the `java -jar` command.

I hope this serves as a good reference but please raise up any mistakes I may have made! Thanks :D

Hello,

I was working on increment Level-7 and Level-8 in their respective branches. After finishing both of them, I forced git to create a merge commit using the `--no-ff` flag as shown below:
```
git merge --no-ff branch-Level-7
```
This worked for merging Level-7 with my master but merging Level-8 raised up merge conflicts with the following message:
```
java_projects/ip$ git merge --no-ff branch-Level-8
Auto-merging src/main/java/Command.java
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/main/java/Command.java
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
I thus went ahead to resolve the conflicts, add and commit the files within the master branch (kindly advice if this is the correct branch to resolve conflicts on). After committing the modified files and running the merge command again, I was greeted instead with an `Already up to date` message. Pushing the commits however, did not create a commit message despite me specifying the `--no-ff` flag earlier. Is this expected behaviour?

Edit: Added screenshot of the commit history on my master branch in case the explanation above was not clear enough :3

Hello!

For git commit messages, I have noticed an inconsistency between an [example given](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/schedule/week2/topics.html#W2-3) in the week 2 topics and the [SE education guide](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html), the latter which I just learned about. For clarity sake, the styles shown in the above 2 links are as below.

My past commits have all been done following the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), which is more inline with the first example above (the notable difference is the capitalisation of the first word in the commit message). Moving forward, may I know which modes of commit styles are allowed and should the case be that the first word must be capitalised, does that mean I have to update all past commit messages? ;-;

Hello,

I would like to clarify if we are required to revisit old tags and fix issues that we might have overlooked. In particular, running runtest.sh for `A-TextUiTesting` threw the following error for me despite passing the test:

<img width="531" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-18 at 2 43 47 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43908963/104852634-17a9a800-5937-11eb-9f54-ef682a67c22b.png">

The error is thrown because I had used a while true loop instead of checking for nextLine in the scanner to take inputs thus far. As I am unaware of how the automated grading scripts work for the previous levels (or rather what they look out for), I am concerned that the previous levels might be affected by the while true loop implementation when ran against the scripts. At the same time, I have also realised that it is impossible to commit to those previous tags which means updating them individually would be quite a hassle.

I would really appreciate advice on this, thank you!

Hello,

I would like to clarify if there is a need for us to concern ourselves with whether repeated task names are allowed/disallowed. Without checking for repeated task names, it would mean the following scenario is possible:

<img width="309" alt="repeated_task_names" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43908963/104815821-f0c57600-5851-11eb-901f-2a905142dd5b.png">

If repeated task names are allowed, then a follow-up question would be is there a need to distinguish them uniquely when tasks are marked as done (this affects implementation).

Kindly advice, thank you!

The split function in java allows a second parameter called limit, which is the threshold for the number of elements obtained in the result.

For example:
```
String str = "Hello there, nice to meet you!";
String[] parsedStr = str.split(" ", 2);
```
In the above example, parsedStr will contain these 2 elements:

Hello Prof @damithc!

Thank you for the response. I am slightly confused by your second statement. The technique taught in the SE-edu guide seems to enforce capitalisation of the first word in the commit message whereas the convention does not. Wouldn't this mean they do not sit well with each other? In fact, the education guide and convention are both contradicting each other so if the former is always the same for every project, wouldn't it mean the latter is never followed? Sorry for the many questions, thank you again for answering!

Edit: Do I have to update past commit messages to adhere to the SE-edu guidelines or is it alright to just do it for future commits? :3

I am not entirely familiar with windows but have you tried running the command as administrator? If you are able to do so, then there is likely a permission issue and you might want to check the ownership for the affected files/folders. Otherwise, this [article](https://windowsreport.com/administrator-access-denied-windows-10/) contains quite a number of options that you might want to explore.

If all else fails and it's convenient for you, it would be good to list some of the options you tried so that someone more competent can come along to help. Sorry I couldn't do much ;-;

From what I can see in the screenshot, you are running the command from `C:\WINDOWS\system32`. The paths specified in both the runtest.sh and runtest.bat files however, use relative paths from the `test-ui-test` directory of the project (notice the presence of .. which refers to the parent directory of where you are executing your command). Try running the command inside the `test-ui-test` directory and see if it works :)
</panel>

<panel  header="**26 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/23#issuecomment-763372122" expanded>

I think it was not explicitly said in the instructions to run the scripts within the `test-ui-test` directory. That said, `..` does not actually refer to `test-ui-test`, rather, it refers to the parent directory of wherever you were running your command from. When you originally ran the command from `C:\WINDOWS\system32`, `..` would have brought you up one directory to WINDOWS. When ran from the `test-ui-test` folder, `..\src\main\java\*.java` first moves up one directory to iP (project folder), then it looks for `src` which it can find in the project folder, then `main`, `java` and finally all the java files inside the java folder.

When you see relative paths specified, it is almost certain you need to run the script from a specific directory (otherwise it is likely you will not be able to find some of the files). At this point you might think why not just use absolute paths, but keeping paths relative does make the program more portable (it's plug and play most of the time). Both have their pros and cons, hope this clarifies :D

@colintkn To add on, you may also consider using the scanner method `hasNextLine()` in your loop condition. In that way, regardless of the input, your loop will only continue if it detects that there are subsequent inputs, thereby eliminating the `NoSuchElementException` you are getting.

Hi @kangtinglee, JUnit comes with these 2 annotations:
```
@BeforeEach
@AfterEach
```
As their names suggest, methods with these annotations are executed before and after each test and I believe that would be where your setup (and teardown) code goes. I am however interested to know if there are any other practices as well :)

> Just want to extend the discussion a little bit: normally we would have a lot of such static final field declarations in our application, then managing the 'expectations' would be quite troublesome already. I guess there would be some place/some way for us to manage what would be expected for the (important) static fields easily (e.g. instead of peeking at individual classes), but I have no clue : |. Anyone knows anything about it?

I agree it's going to be huge hassle with lots of static final field declarations. Off the top of my head, I imagine for larger applications with lots of static final field declarations of string types, these strings may be stored/read from inside a `messages.yml` or `messages.json` file of sorts (has the added benefit of easy configuration/changing messages without directly editing the file containing code). It might then be possible to construct a single test class pertaining to all these messages which should at least centralise the testing and makes things slightly more organised. What do you think?

@gycc7253 You might need to check if the parent directory for your file actually exist before attempting to create it. For example, if you were creating a file as below, the data directory might not be present yet:
```
File file = new File("./data/tasks.txt");
```
In which case, you may need an extra line of code after that to create the data directory:
```
file.getParentFile().mkdirs();

Out of curiosity, I compiled the project with nothing marked as root and randomly marking a file as root. Turns out even though IntelliJ flagged out problems for the latter, compilation of the project still worked in all cases and the JAR file runs perfectly fine. I did notice that the editor has some useful labels (for example parameter names) that only appear when you have the `Sources Root` set correctly. Otherwise, just from this small tinkering around it does seem like setting the root is more of an enhancement.

From the first line of the instruction, it says to create the folder `[project_name]\src\test\java\`. This would imply the java folder is supposed to be created manually which you have already done. I did not actually change anything inside the test.iml file although more on what the file is about is explained [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-managing-modules.html).

@rajobasu By external file do you mean other java files within the same package? I imagine static variables in these files would then be referred to through their class names so maybe something like `Dummy.staticVariableHere` (static methods would also be referenced similarly).

@rajobasu Both [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) and [YAML](https://circleci.com/blog/what-is-yaml-a-beginner-s-guide/) are file formats for storing data. You are right to say they will have to be loaded and these are usually done through third-party libraries which differ across programming languages. For JSON in java, we have the likes of [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) and [json-simple](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/). These libraries provide means for us to load in the data from those files which we can then assign to `static final` variables. Hope that clarifies :D

Edit: Exception handling will need to be done for reading/writing from `.json` and `.yml` files but is handled within the code. The files themselves just hold the information. I am not actually sure this is the best way to do things but there is the benefit of consolidating messages within a file and modifying them without having to touch the codebase directly.

@rajobasu That's a really great point. I have been theory-crafting up till this point and am honestly unsure of how file contents can be specifically loaded into `static final` variables. I did a quick google search and you are right about the approach with initialisation class/codes. As to why they would not feel ideal, could you share more? I imagine even if this doesn't work well for messages, would it still at least work well for a configuration file?

Edit: I think it might be possible to group constants of a similar nature together instead of by class (for example messages pertaining to information). I am not sure what associated dangers there may be because any sensitive information should not be stored in plain text to begin with. Are there any dangers I am overlooking?

Ahhh... I think I am starting to get how the `.iml` files work (I hope 😅). Just throwing out a hypothesis but it seems the `&gt;sourceFolder>` tag specifies which modules the `.iml` file applies to. It should then technically be possible for a single `.iml` file to apply to multiple modules in a project (hence the multiple `&gt;sourceFolder>` tag in your original `ip.iml`). Should that be true, it might be that `ip.iml` was taking priority (for whatever reason) over your `test.iml` file, hence triggering the error you saw. I am guessing it would also work if you copy the contents for `JUnit` from the `test.iml` file into `ip.iml` file but since it's working now I guess it's good xD

For a void method I think it depends on what the method itself achieves. I had a similar situation where my void methods were merely printing outputs and this [guide](https://www.baeldung.com/java-testing-system-out-println) here proved very helpful. In another scenario, it is possible that a void method alters a particular attribute of an object and in that case, I believe checking if the attribute was altered successfully would suffice. For these cases, the `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` annotations would come in useful.

So I just double checked and I have a data folder created at `./out/artifacts/ip_jar/data` for my case where I stored my data file in `./data/tasks.json`.

The use of double `..` will bring you two directories up to the `out` folder but I am unsure how this will help with your case :sweat_smile: Since you are getting an access denied error, try running the cmd prompt as an administrator. If this works, you can check your folder/file permissions :)

I suggest working with a simple `./data/Kelbot.txt` for now (which means a data folder at where your jar file is and the text file will be created within it). Access denied does sound like a separate problem which will require you to check read/write permissions but take it step by step and see if you are able to run the jar file as administrator from the cmd prompt first :)

When running the code directly in Intellij, the file is created with respect to the root directory of `ip` (`./data/Kelbot.txt` in this case would mean having a data folder in the same place as where your `src` folder is). When you build it as a jar and run it with `java -jar` instead, the file is now created with respect to the jar file. At least that's how I understand/have observed it (I hope I have not been rambling on wrongly ;-;). But stick with `./` and see if it works out. If access denied still pops up, try running as administrator in cmd prompt and see if that helps too :D

Essentially yup! You have 2 different `data/Kelbot.txt` (one from directly in IntelliJ, one from running as jar). In fact you can move the jar file to elsewhere on your computer and the new data folder will take reference from wherever you moved it too.

I am not sure if this is actually relevant to the error you are facing (although with your current structure, copy pasting the `.iml` files without modifications will likely fail). Nonetheless, if you are willing to do a minor restructure on your project, you can consider the following:

1) Instead of marking the `src` folder as your `Sources Root`, mark the `java` folder within your `main` folder as your `Sources Root` (this does mean you need to change your package statements in your java files). 

2) Then, you may follow this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html) which essentially brings you through replicating the folder structure under `test` folder to mirror that of the `main` folder (your test classes need to be created in a matching package). You would then end up with a structure similar to this:
```
src
  - main
    - java (Sources Root)
      - duke
        - *.java 
  - test
    - java (Test Sources Root)
      - duke
        - *.java 
```
It's a bit neater to see both `main` and `test` folders mirroring each other and the `.iml` file you referred to earlier should fit nicely with this structure as well. See if this actually helps with your issue, otherwise you might want to share your test class as well :D

The screenshots are a bit blurry so I cannot see all the import errors but a point to note is that once you mark the `java` folder within the `main` folder as `Sources Root`, you need to change your `package` statements for all your java files to be `package duke;` as `java` would not be part of the package name.

For your ParserTest.java, once the project is structured correctly, you may refer to option 1 of point 8 in this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html).

I am not sure why there is an error arising from marking roots but you may consider unmarking all of them first then re-marking them again. Hopefully these will help resolve some of your above issues.

You shouldn't have to explicitly import `Duke` in your test class. Use `Duke` in the test class as you would normally in the main class and a prompt would pop up for you again to rectify the error.

From the point of a user, I believe the second option is more intuitive and friendly. I would probably appreciate it more if every successful operation is saved such that a random crash later on won't affect all previous operations xD

Edit: On a relevant note, the discussion can also be taken further to discuss how saving/loading is done. For every operation, do you write to the file and then read from it again to repopulate/update the array list of task that you have, or do you have another piece of code to modify the already loaded array list of task? 

I think with the current size of the program and a task limit of 100, this would not matter but scalability wise, if the number of tasks start growing significantly, then it might get expensive to keep reading/writing all tasks from the file.

> 1. Save a Task

I think this would be handled as an IOException within the method responsible for saving tasks. Ideally the code should re-generate the missing folders/file if they are found to not exist but upon a failed creation (maybe due to permission issues), it should terminate the entire program with a proper exit message.

> If I were to re-generate missing file structures, then I would also need to consider adding previously existing tasks in the list to the file as well, otherwise, there will be a mismatch between what is in the file vs what is in the task list at run-time. This could cause problems as well if the user modifies a task added before the file was re-generated (e.g. mark a task as done in the application, and this task is present in memory but not present in the file on the user's hard drive).

Now that you say this I didn't actually consider re-generating the file with previously existing tasks even though that sounds like a best case scenario for the user - more patch up to do :'DDD

Since all your classes are in a single duke package, all you need to do is ensure that all of your java files have `package duke;` at the very first line and you will be able to refer to the classes directly by their names :)

Hello! You might want to double check if you have both checkstyle.xml and suppressions.xml placed under src/config/checkstyle/ 

Check your build.gradle file as well and make sure you got your checkstyle.xml from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle)

Correct me if I am wrong but I felt the tutorial used `Main` and `Duke` interchangeably a couple of times in the third tutorial. In one of the steps they said `Main` class but their example was showing that of `Duke`. For the fragment of code you showed in your first post, I believe you might get something if you add `stage.show()` right after `stage.setScene()`. If it is convenient and you would like to you can give it a try. Otherwise if the issue is already resolved that's great too :D

This is oddly strange all your previous closed pull requests seem to reflect the latest of your code changes. For both the pull requests you mentioned in your first screenshot (and which you have closed), they are both seen to be 40 commits ahead of the upstream master. In the second screenshot, the number of commits also show 40 although it seems the commit lines do not reflect that. Have you tried peeking at your pull requests when signed out/from another browser?

I bumped into this yesterday while working on part 4 of javafx tutorial. I googled a bit about it but didn't read too much into it except javafx did seem to have a hand in the 'InvocationTargetException' :P As far as I can recall I think it "wraps" itself around other exceptions (in your case that would be 'NullPointerException) but if you click on the other exception through the bottom left panel in your screenshot, you should be able to get the stacktrace for the underlying error :D

Double check your `checkstyle.xml` and `suppressions.yml` are correctly retrieved from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle). This thread [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/70) has a similar issue and it seems to be related to the checkstyle file contents.

If you took the checkstyle file from AB3 directly then to be very honest I am not sure as well since the file contents I had were also from AB3 😅. Perhaps it has to do with the way it was retrieved (I copied the raw contents of the file, didn't actually download it).

In your `Launcher.java`, are you calling `Main` or `Duke`? I suppose with your current structure, it should be calling the `Main` class like this:
```
Application.launch(Main.class, args);

In this case, your `Main` class would be the one extending `Application` instead of your `Duke` class.

Edit: You don't need to write an `init` method :) You will however want to extend `Application` in `Main` instead of `Duke`. To elaborate a bit more, the top level of my package contains the 3 classes `Launcher`, `Main` and `Duke`. `Launcher` is the entry point and calls the `Main` class which extends `Application`. Within the `Main` class, the `start` method is overridden and the `Duke` class is called from `Main` class.

If you are using gradle then the compilation should be done with `gradlew build` or `gradlew clean shadowJar` depending on which tutorial you followed. If you are using `javac` I believe third party dependencies need to be specified with the `-cp` flag.

I have issues locating your `Launcher` class in the branch you provided (is it not committed and pushed yet?) but if you are calling `Duke` directly from `Launcher`, then you need to refactor your `Duke` class to not take in any arguments in its constructor.

On a side note, your repository has a number of `.class` files that are likely a product of the `javac` command. You might want to clean those up first by going to `src/main/java/duke/` and typing `rm *.class`. The folders in this directory mostly contain `.class` files as well so you might want to clean them up as you deem fit given that your `java` files all sit in the same package.

To be honest I did not face this issue because my `Duke` class never took any parameters in the first place xD So after you asked, I just dug a bit deeper and it turns out arguments are allowed to be passed, but they are specified in a particular way and requires the import of `javafx.application.Application.Parameters;`. There is a specific syntax for passing and retrieving the arguments which are neatly outlined [here](https://java-programming-fall-19.mooc.now.sh/part-13/4-launch-parameters) if you wish to explore :D

I am not using `@ParameterizedTest` myself so I am not too familiar but for a start you might want to standardise the JUnit versions specified in your dependencies first (perhaps to 5.5.0). After which try reloading/reopening your project and see if `@ParameterizedTest` would be recognised :)

If you are getting this error I assume you are on part 4 of the tutorial. In which case. there is a need to refactor the `getUserDialog` method to take in `String` in the parameter instead because the code in part 3 of the tutorial actually implemented `Label` as parameter.

Edit: A couple of other fields are affected as well such as `Image` and `ImageView`. A quick look at the codes from both part 3 and part 4 of the tutorial should reflect the parts that need refactoring :)

Not sure if this will be helpful but if you are able to pull up command logs within sourcetree, looking at the commands executed might yield some details (the equivalent of `history` on the command line)

Edit: Just theorising here. Based on pure observation alone, in the line `Fix coding violations pointed out by peers`, there was a 3-branch split into assertions (green), codequality (red) and what appears to be a pseudo master (yellow). Perhaps github/sourcetree have some underlying implementations for pull requests resulting in this yellow branch but I am just making wild guesses at this point. Moving on, my guess of the flow is that assertions (green) branch was first completed and merged into your actual master (blue). A merge was then performed automatically to the pseudo master (yellow) to keep the branch updated. The codequality (red) branch then merges the new commits from the pseudo master (yellow) before merging itself to the actual master (blue).

Googling the error returns quite a number of [results ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47509287/run-javafx-jar-as-sudo-unable-to-open-display) that seem to lean the issue heavily towards permissions/dependencies, though they seem to occur mostly on `ubuntu`. That said for your `MainWindow.fxml` file, `fx:controller="MainWindow"` needs to reflect the path to where your `MainWindow.java` file is sitting at.

Not sure what may have changed since your remote repository was last updated 2 days ago but a few points that might help: 

- In your `build.gradle` try changing `mainClassName` to `duke.Launcher` instead.
- Your images are named as `Duke.JPG` and `User.JPG`, try matching the casing as well.
- Use png files instead of jpg files.

Hopefully one of the above helps! :)

You may not have modified other test files within `src/test` but the modifications to the classes within `src/main` may be the reason for this failed test cases. Seeing as there are only 11 failing test cases, they should be resolvable with more persistent digging. Unfortunately it is a bit hard to tell from the screenshots alone what the causes are. Alternatively, you may push a temporary branch and link it here for others to have a better look. All the best! :D

The `no newline at EOF` error means you need to hit enter after the last line in `/src/main/main.iml` and `/src/test/test.iml` to insert a newline at EOF (end of file).

The warning about trailing whitespace means that at the end of the specified line, there is an extra space that needs to be removed.

Though on a side note, I noticed my team's tP does not have .iml files present under `/src/main` and `/src/test` :3

Hello! I have been leaving the branches as they are and if there is a need to say `update-user-guide` again, I checkout to the branch, fetch and merge it with the upstream repository's master branch and then proceed on with the work to be done. 

I personally feel that for a branch, if one is certain that it will be a one-time update, it is alright to delete it (though for the purpose of this module I think they track our branches to see if we follow the forking workflow so better to leave it). 

On the other hand, if there will be constant updates with regards to a particular feature, I would keep the branch there and just be sure to update it before making any further changes. This has been working out for me but I'd like to hear alternatives as well :D

I think it depends on the scale of the feature being worked on as well as the approach chosen to work on it. If a small feature was being worked on, then draft requests may not be necessary as pull requests completing smaller features should in theory be more manageable.

On the other hand, if a feature is big enough to warrant discussion/help, then perhaps that justifies the need for a draft pull request although I am under the impression that it is usually best to break down a huge feature into smaller tasks which then brings me back to my first point.

All that said I think it is possible to use draft pull requests without constantly failing CI if coding standards are adhered to and the affected test cases temporarily commented out (probably not the ideal practice but a solution nonetheless). Githooks may also be setup locally to prevent instances of commits done without first passing checkstyle and test cases locally (I personally think this helps a lot with reducing unnecessary "fix checkstyle commits").

I searched a bit after reading your question and came across a very [useful link](https://www.stubbornjava.com/posts/java-enum-lookup-by-name-or-field-without-throwing-exceptions) that I have since used to improve the enum in my team's current code base.

Going with the assumption that the string literals will be used in multiple places, then the general approach I may suggest is as such:

1) Using an enum for greetings as an example, create an enum class and incorporate the static map index solution from the above link:
```
public enum GreetingsEnum {
    HELLO, HI, HEY;

    //solution below is adapted from the above link
    private static final Map<String, GreetingsEnum> index = new HashMap<>();

    //populate the map above
    static {
        for (GreetingsEnum greeting : GreetingsEnum.values()) {
            index.put(greeting.name(), greeting);
        }
    }

    //for checking if value is present
    public static boolean getIfPresent(String greeting) {
        return getGreeting(greeting) != null;
    }

    //for retrieving value
    public static GreetingsEnum getGreeting(String greeting) {
        return index.get(greeting.toUpperCase());
    }
}
```
2) You may then use it in other places of your code by importing `GreetingsEnum` and using the static methods. For example:
```
//to check if a greeting is valid
public static boolean isValidGreeting(String test) {
    return GreetingsEnum.getIfPresent(test);
}
```

Hope this helps! :)

In that case, would citing personal preferences for a user guide that shows the full screenshot of the application even if the individual components are not hard to identify be legitimate?

I am mainly thinking that if the primary advantage of using partial screenshots is to ease maintenance (do not have to frequently update screenshots), then the decision to use full screenshots should rest on the developer team (i.e. if the team feels UI updates will not be frequent and wishes to include the full screenshot, it should not be flagged as a bug). 

The above is of course assuming there is no 'harm' done to the users reading the guide which I am doubtful will happen because a full UI screenshot is likely to be even more straightforward.

Hi, will like to seek advice for how to approach this issue. So, I am trying to draw the sequence diagram for an add property command, but since the input command string is kind of long (have already omitted optional fields), if I were to put the whole string in the sequence diagram, then the diagram will be very long in width. Hence, I am not sure what is the best way to label it in this case. I have thought that maybe I can omit all the parameters of the functions (such as the `parseCommand` label below), but this solution seems less than ideal, as it does not help to illustrate the different input string parameters of the respective functions. Hope to get some recommendations here on how to approach this.

Hi, I have a few questions regarding the storage classes implementation in AB3. 

The `StorageManager` class implements the `Storage` interface, which in turn extends two other interfaces, `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`. `AddressBookStorage` interface has 5 methods to be implemented and `UserPrefsStorage` has 3 methods to be implemented. Even though `Storage` interface has 5 methods, all 5 of these methods are overriden methods from either of the two interfaces that it extends. Thus, this results in `StorageManger` having to implement all 8 methods.

So, firstly, what is the purpose of the `Storage` interface when the `StorageManager` class can directly implement the two grandparent interfaces?
Secondly, if the answer for the first question is to simply provide a convenient API for the user to see, why did the `Storage` interface only specify 5 of 8 methods? 
(I can understand if 2 of the methods, `readAddressBook` and `saveAddressBook`, are omitted because they are overloaded methods that just provide convenience for user to call, but what about the `getUserPrefsFilePath` method? Shouldn't this `getUserPrefsFilePath` method be specified in the `Storage` interface if `getAddressBookFilePath` is specified too?)

Sorry for the long question but hopefully someone can enlighten me 😅

Another follow up question is when do we know if a class should be tested using unit testing (isolated from other class and only uses stubs if necessary) or integration testing?

Hi, 

how do I right-align my user commands to the application window, and also after i resize the window? (The structure is similar to the JavaFX tutorial, in which I have a Label inside a DialogBox(HBox) now)

Hello, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/106261434-87376580-625c-11eb-988c-b4ee1cc1d1ed.png)

In the class diagram shown, from what I can gather,
- Each `Foo` object is connected to 2 other instances of `Foo` objects
- Each `Foo` object has 0 or more `Foo` objects stored with the variable name `bar`

What I think how the sample code for `Foo` looks like is:
```
class Foo {
    Foo f1;
    Foo f2;   // I am assuming that f2 cannot be the same instance as f1
    Foo bar;  // bar can be the same instance of Foo as f1 or f2
}
```

However, in the video, it is mentioned that option b is correct even though the bottom 2 instances of `Foo` are connected to only 1 other instance of `Foo`. I would think that option b is only correct if the bottom 2 instances of `Foo` are connected to each other (or some other instances). Can someone help clarify if I am wrong in my understanding? Thank you.

Hi, may I ask if the java convention disallow empty catch clauses? 

In my use case below, I am allowing users to pass in multiple date/time formats, for e.g. 23/1/2021 1800 and just 23/1/2021. Thus, I created an enum `InputDateFormat` that specifies different date/time formats (also, is the use of an enum here appropriate?). Then when I try to parse the user input date string, I use a for loop to loop through all the date/time formats (the enums values) and attempt to parse them into a `LocalDateTime` object. If the first attempt fails, I catch the exception and continue the for loop to attempt to parse again.

Is this a valid way to use empty catch clauses? Or should I re-implement this design in another way? (Or does anyone have any suggestions on how we can handle multiple date/time formats?)

Tip on how to add/remove past tags from both the remote repo (github) and your local repo through the command line:
`git push --delete origin &gt;tag_name>` : removes the tag from the remote repo (github)
`git tag --delete &gt;tag_name>` : removes the tag from your own local repo
`git tag -a &gt;tag_name> &gt;commit_SHA1_hash>` : to manually tag a commit (as compared to `git tag -a &gt;tag_name>` which tags the latest commit only). Note that the SHA1 hash of a commit is a 40-character hash that is computed every time you make a commit, and also you only need to specify around the first 8 of the characters of the hash

An example of the SHA1 hash:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/105580274-65eef900-5dc6-11eb-926a-0a8428996d81.png)
(An example tag command could therefore be `git tag -a Level-8 c0b35c1a`)

Do note that deleting tag in either the remote or local repo does not remove the tag in the other. You have to run both the commands to remove a tag completely from both remote and local repo if you want.

I believe you can add ".gitignore" inside the _.gitignore_ file itself to ignore it (if the _.gitignore_ file has never been commited before). 
However, if the _.gitignore_ file has already been tracked previously, it will still show up in git status. One way to solve this can be to add the ignores to _.git/info/exclude_ in the repository instead. 
(Refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10176875/add-gitignore-to-gitignore#:~:text=gitignore%20file's%20purpose%20is%20to,be%20included%20in%20the%20repository for more information)

As an aside, regarding the iP, I believe we should still commit the _.gitignore_ file actually.

Hi Prof, thanks for the clarification. There seems to be a workaround (using chcp 65001) but it involves the end users changing their system configuration.

You can double check if the JDK location is correct (without any other subfolders behind the jdk-11.0.6). You may also try rebooting your IntelliJ/computer after ensuring the JDK location is correct.

Did you manually push the tags to your remote repository? Tags are not pushed to the remote repository by default. You can try running the command `git push origin --tags` to push all your tags to the remote repository.

> Hi! I think that as for this week's tasks it would not be of a great difference to choose either one of the two. However, personally, I prefer to create an object of Duke instead of making its methods and variables static.
> 
> Besides the vry good reasons mentioned by @kormingsoon, my answer would add on more from the perspective of OOP practice. If we use static methods/variables in Duke, it means that the states of Duke can be affected by all the instances of the class. Thus the Duke class is not in complete control of its own states, and those static methods can be seen as methods at a global stage. As a result, the principle of encapsulation is not well followed here and it results in more coupling between components.
> 
> Thus, personally I think creating a Duke object would be better.

I think this is a very good point raised by @richardcom, as static methods/fields can be accessed by all instances of the class. 
Below is what I think but I am not very sure if my logic/understanding is accurate though. (Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong!) 

What if this chatbot is to be used by multiple users at once? Then the likely scenario is that there will be multiple threads that each create a new instance of the Duke chatbot to engage with the user. However, with static methods/fields, all of the different instances of Duke chatbot will be accessing the same field. 

Take for example, if we have a static attribute `static List&gt;Task> taskList = new ArrayList&gt;>();` and static methods `addTask(Task task)` and `printAllTasks()`. Then when user A and user B each add a task to their own instance of chatbot and proceed to print their tasks respectively, each user will be able to see both taskA (task that user A added) and taskB (task that user B added) inside their list!!! 

Therefore, I think making the methods and attributes belong to the instance of the class will make more sense in this case.

> Alternatively, we may make use of the `.next()` from the `Scanner` object you have created. It automatically takes in the next String in the input, which is the command word in our case. Then, based on the command, we can carry out relevant steps, for example a `.nextLine()` to read in the rest of the line.
> 
> However, I do agreee with @tjtanjin that his way of splitting may be more elegent during implementation:) Hope it helps in providing another perspective.

Used this method mentioned by @litone01 as well. However, one thing to note is that if you use `.next()` to scan for the command first, and proceed to use `.nextLine()` to scan for the remaining string immediately, then the test script _input.txt_ should end with a newline character as the method `.nextLine()` is blocking. For e.g. the _input.txt_ file should be something like

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/104986292-b6282d00-5a4d-11eb-830d-b5f36f6d5c52.png)
(where the last empty line in the file simulates the user pressing "enter/return" keyboard button)

Without the last empty line, and if `.next()` is immediately followed by `.nextLine()`, the command would not be executed as the `.nextLine()` call would be blocking to wait for an input that is not there. A workaround without the last empty line may to be check the whether the command is "bye" right after the `.next()` method, and not calling `.nextLine()` if the command is indeed "bye". But I do not think this is a good way to code our program.


However, I do agree that the `.split(regex, limit)` method provided by @tjtanjin is much more cleaner and simpler! Didn't think of this previously. May want to update my code accordingly too 😅

I do not think that using enums for exceptions is wrong by any means, but I do agree that using enums for exceptions does not seem to be the best choice. An enum cannot extend any other class, and in particular, it cannot extend the Exception class (or Throwable class), which means that it will not be able to inherit any methods/fields of the Exception/Throwable classes (and also you won't be able to use the `throw` keyword too). You will have to implement them yourself if you choose to create a standalone enum.

Hi @tjtanjin, I believe what you have now is already correct. The latest commit shown in the screenshot above (with hash 83e2ae5) is the result of the merge between the `master` branch (which was already merged with the `branch-Level-7` branch previously) and the branch `branch-Level-8`. 

> ```
> java_projects/ip$ git merge --no-ff branch-Level-8
> Auto-merging src/main/java/Command.java
> CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/main/java/Command.java
> Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
> ```

When you run this command which attempts to merge `branch-Level-8` with branch `master`, there is a merge conflict and you went on to modify the files and probably ran `git add` (which marks the file as resolved), followed by `git commit` (which actually finalizes the merge conflict, i.e. commits it). 


> I thus went ahead to resolve the conflicts, add and commit the files within the master branch (kindly advice if this is the correct branch to resolve conflicts on). After committing the modified files and running the merge command again, I was greeted instead with an `Already up to date` message. Pushing the commits however, did not create a commit message despite me specifying the `--no-ff` flag earlier. Is this expected behaviour?

Therefore, when you run the `git merge` command again, the system prompts you that it is already up to date because the `master` branch is already merged with the `branch-Level-8` branch. I believe after this you do a `git push` command to push the changes from your local repo to your remote repo and hence you have 4 commits as shown.
The 4 commits are correct from the steps you took, with their messages originating from:
1. The commit message from committing in `branch-Level-7`
2. The commit message from  committing in `branch-Level-8`
3. The commit message from merging branch `branch-Level-7` with `master`
4. The commit message from merging branch `branch-Level-8` with `master` (you probably wrote "Fix: fix merge conflicts" when you finalize the merge command with `git commit` as explained above)

Thanks @litone01 for sharing, and maybe I can add on by sharing how to add/remove past tags from both github and your local repo through the command line.
`git push --delete origin &gt;tag_name>` : removes the tag from the remote repo (github)
`git tag --delete &gt;tag_name>` : removes the tag from your own local repo
`git tag -a &gt;tag_name> &gt;commit_SHA1_hash>` : to manually tag a commit (as compared to `git tag -a &gt;tag_name>` which tags the latest commit only). Note that the SHA1 hash of a commit is a 40-character hash that is computed every time you make a commit, and also you only need to specify around the first 8 of the characters of the hash
An example:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/105580274-65eef900-5dc6-11eb-926a-0a8428996d81.png)
(an example tag command could be `git tag -a Level-8 c0b35c1a`)

Do note that deleting tag in either the remote or local repo does not remove the tag in the other. You have to run both the commands to remove a tag completely from both remote and local repo if you want.

> Ahhh... I think I am starting to get how the `.iml` files work (I hope 😅). Just throwing out a hypothesis but it seems the `&gt;sourceFolder>` tag specifies which modules the `.iml` file applies to. It should then technically be possible for a single `.iml` file to apply to multiple modules in a project (hence the multiple `&gt;sourceFolder>` tag in your original `ip.iml`). Should that be true, it might be that `ip.iml` was taking priority (for whatever reason) over your `test.iml` file, hence triggering the error you saw. I am guessing it would also work if you copy the contents for `JUnit` from the `test.iml` file into `ip.iml` file but since it's working now I guess it's good xD

@CSmortal You can open up your expand out all your packages by doing this: Press the settings icon right beside your project, and uncheck Compact middle packages.

Try to unmark all your packages by right-clicking and selecting "Unmark as ...", and then proceed to only mark your `java` folder in src/main as Sources Root and mark your `java` folder in src/test as Test Sources Root.

In addition, you may want to share your `.iml` files if doing the above still doesn't work.

I have noted that a `LocalDateTime` object has to have both a date and time field, so when the user pass in only a date format, e.g. `LocalDateTime.parse("23/1/2021", DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("d/M/y"))` actually returns an error. In this case, my original for loop will fail too. 

Therefore, I have decided to parse the date and time strings separately and use both a `LocalDate` instance attribute and a `LocalTime`  instance attribute in my `DeadlineTask` class to describe the full date and time. Am thinking if just using a simple split method over using regex to parse the input date and time will be better in this case.

The order of imports should be as follow (from top to bottom):

1. static imports
2. standard java imports (imports from standard java api, e.g. `import java.util.Scanner`, `java.time.LocalDate`, etc)
3. special imports (such as imports from your own packages, e.g. `import duke.commands`)
4. third party imports (such as from javafx library)

It seems weird that you have a `main.iml` file in addition to the `ip.iml` file. When did the `main.iml` file get created? Can you try deleting the `main.iml` file and check the contents of your `ip.iml` file?
You may want to compare it to my `ip.iml` file, and take a look at the highlighted line (which is different from yours)

> @w2vgd I managed to get rid of the warnings by digging the checkstyle.xml and comment out the code block for MemberName (line 120). But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Hi @figo2127, just my personal opinion but I would think its best not to comment out that part since it serves to check if all of your member variables are named correctly (those that are non-final too). Although the check is kind of simple as I seen from the regex, i.e. only making sure that the variable name starts with a lowercase and that the name only consist of letters and digits, I think that it may still be useful as a final safety check (given that we have quite a number of files to check, and even more so for tP later on). 

As such, I have reverted to using camelCase for static non-final member variables to comply with the checkstyle rules (because I can't stand the warnings generated by checkstyle 😅).

Hint 1: For the greeting message, think about how similar it is to your current messages, i.e. what kind of node are you using to display the current messages now and also how are you adding them to your application now. After that, think about the sequence of event that happens when you boot up your application, i.e. the lifecyle of a JavaFX application (I have attached an image below for your reference). Think about when/where you can add that node to your current window :)

Hint 2: For the bye message, think about where you can add an additional check for the command passed in by the user. Can the check be done in `handleUserInput` or should it be done in `getResponse`? What method can you call to exit the program if the command is actually an exit/bye command?

> Also really ,thanks, but my tests are still goners though... This is my screenshot of my folder structure just in case I didn't mark it again...

Does your test folder directly mirror the original main folder? In this case, for example, is your structure for your `Duke` class in the `main` folder as follows:
`main` -&gt; `java` -&gt; `duke` -&gt; `Duke.java` ?
and similarly for your `Event` and `Todo` classes. They have to be in the exact same folder structure as the `main` folder.

Hi, I think that the "Trailing Whitespace" error is not caused by the blank lines, but rather it is caused by literally trailing white spaces in the specific line. 

For example, this does not give any checkstyle violations:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/107137249-ab263580-6945-11eb-84d1-66a9a812cd67.png)

While this gives the "Trailing Whitespace" checkstyle violation:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/107137257-cabd5e00-6945-11eb-81f2-9d3c1d2ea571.png)
(Notice the extra whitespace at the end of line 42?)

All you have to do is to go to the line as indicated by the checkstyle violation, and remove all the whitespaces that are at the end of the line. 
Or a faster method is actually to right click your java folder, and click `Reformat Code`.

Hope this helps 😄

Additional tip: 
For people who feel that its annoying to have all formats of `todo` marked as a TODO item (which will fill up your TODO list with unwanted tasks), what I did was to go to `Settings` -&gt; `Editor` -&gt; `TODO` and format the patterns manually (or you can even delete it). I ticked the case sensitive checkbox and specify the pattern to be all uppercase letters so that only when i type `TODO` then it will be marked as a legitimate todo item as shown in the image below:

In addition to comparing just the advantages either streams or loops bring, I think its also worthwhile to look into the disadvantages and also perhaps some "inconveniences" that each brings. I find this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44180101/in-java-what-are-the-advantages-of-streams-over-loops) summarizing the advantages/disadvantages quite succinctly. There seems to be a common consensus that loops are much easier to read as many have mentioned above. 

> But I was wondering from the industry standpoint, would software engineers tend to be more comfortable with loops or streams? Is there some kind of industry preference out there if any of you guys have an internship experience.

In particular, the "Familiarity" portion of the answer from the stackoverflow post mentioned that since streams are not available in every language and is a relatively newer concept, I guess loops are generally considered more comfortable for many.

But of course it still depends on each programmer in the end. And also while working in a team or on a brownfield project, I guess you will still have to follow what others use so that the style of coding is consistent throughout?

Do note that you should not use use `AssertionError` or `assert` statements to handle invalid user input. Imagine if the user accidentally pass in a command "appl" and then the program crashes because of a small typo, I think that the user will be quite shocked to say the least. The program cannot recover from an assertion error because throwing an assertion error will mean that something has gone horribly wrong in the code at this point and any further execution may likely result in unwanted consequences. 

As what @candyhy has mentioned, you should use exceptions to handle invalid user input and propagate that exception to be handled by the caller parent method instead. There is also nothing wrong with adding that the method throws some exceptions in the method signature too. This is to help you ensure that any method who calls this method will have to handle this exception.

Implementation-wise for the base AddressBook code, the order of the paramters does not matter at all (even for the optional paramters). I believe you can put the optional parameters at the front too and it will still be parsed correctly by the `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultimap` classes. So if you will like to include an additional parameter, the only thing to do is to use a different unique prefix so that the parsing can be done correctly. 

The documentations that you mentioned where optional parameters cannot be followed by required parameters is because for programming languages, I think that this will simplify the design of the programming language as it will be hard to detect when the parameters are not being provided anymore for a function if there are optional parameters before a required parameter. 

However, for AddressBook, since it uses unique prefixes to separate the arguments, we can still pass in the arguments in any way we like. (Someone correct me if I am wrong)

Everytime you start the app, or run a command, logging output is printed to such files for logging purposes (think of it as the black box for recording what happened when you are using the app). Every single run of the app will write to such files, and if a single file exceeds 5MB, a new file will be created to continue to record the logging output, for a maximum of up to 5 files. (Not sure what happens after 5 files though, but my guess is it will just not record anything anymore). 

You can delete the log file after every run if you like.

If you will like to know where the code for producing such a file comes from, it comes from `LogsCenter.java`

Ahhhh I see. Thanks for the clarification prof @damithc. I guess we should update the interface in our own implementation then 😄

Just something that came to notice while making some regex on which I spent some time debugging, hence mentioning it here. 

If you want to match ``` “\x” ``` where ```’\’``` is not an escape character, it should be written as ```”\\\\”```. First, Strings treat ```”\\”``` as a single ```”\”```, and so does regex, so we kind-of have to do it twice.

Hi Prof, 
That is my understanding as well. But in that case, doesn't "building a new feature fully" mean completing a full component and thus is an example of depth-first ?

I feel since the Duke is the main entry point, it should be only used to set up other processes like an Input loop. Everything else should be taken care of other classes, the main method and indeed the Duke class itself should be very minimal! That is usually how I write my code at least.

Um, I have a question that how do you exactly define ```static final``` variables from an external file? The only way I can think of is using constructs like 
```
class A{
    static {
    
    }
}
```

However, is this a good way to do this? What if the thing fails? Exception handling will be hard as well since you have to do everything mostly in these places, so not that modular right? 

Just want to know what the best practices are for these things.

Yea I know about JSON/json loaders but the thing is that where will you put the code for that? since it’s a static final variable, needs to be in static blocks right? But then, assuming all classes usually have some static constants, you can’t really instantiate anything in that case right due to circular logic. So you would end up having to put a lot of the initialisation code inside the static blocks, which don’t feel ideal to me. Agreed that there is a benefit of keeping constants at the same place, but do you even really want that? 

Think about it from another perspective :  not all constants are ```public``` (and in general most aren't). Putting them in the same place can be dangerous. Secondly, if you want to keep separate files for the constants in different class, might as well just hardcode them. 
Atleast these came to my mind!

By the way, is the following true?
- check only methods which are returning something — ie very modular.

You might also want to look at try-with-resources, which basically closes ```AutoClosable``` objects automatically. 
Second, @georgepwhuang mentioned about garbage collectors, related to that is the ```finalize()``` method as well. 
It is called just before the object is to be garbage collected. However there is a caveat here. Look at the following code: 

```
Class A {
    static A ref = null;
    static boolean x = false;  
    public void finalize() {
        if(x) {
            
              // close some stuff ( —— line (1) )
            return;
        }
        A.ref = this;
        A.x = true;
    }
    public static void main(String… args) {
        A a = new A();
        a = null;
        // force garbage collector, lets say (even though you can’t do it, but just for argument) to garbage collect the object.
        a = A.ref;
        A.ref = null;
        // again force gc.
    }
}
```

You would assume that the line(1) would be called atleast once right?
Turns out no!!!

The first time the object is garbage collected, we forcefully keep a reference. So it is not garbage collected.
The second time, that garbage collector **doesn’t call finalize()** at all! 
It’s only called the first time the object is about to be garbage collected. ONLY THEN.
As a corollary, I also showed how after calling finalize, the garbage collection might get botched altogether!

I believe that in this specific scenario, there are two things we can essentially do: 
 - As OP mentioned, we can leave it as a blank catch since it doesn’t make sense to do anything with the exception. Indeed, upon some digging this might also be the Oracle recommended way? Look at [this](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/format.html) article, seems like there is no testParse() function available anyway, the main way to deal with this error is throwing an exception. 
 - Second, which I think is better albeit tedious, is to fix the input to a particular format and then regex it yourself before making a LocalDateTime from it, since throwing Exceptions is a very costly thing to do in a program just like that. 

In general, Exceptions are supposed to deal with **exceptional** situations, which is not so in this case obviously. Hence, they in general should be dealt with by a non-empty code block.

There are two perspectives to this problem I feel: 
- From a user standpoint, saving every change is obviously optimal. I feel we should give the user a choice to save only when pressing save, or save automatically (as is the case in many applications). 
- Is it fast if there is a lot of changes? 

Well, naivest way to do is every time you load all the tasks in the memory, do wtvr the user asks you to do, and before exiting just save everything to the file. 
- this is bad becoz if user terminates by some other way, all changes are lost. 
- Good becoz it is fast since everything is done in memory

Second way is to do the same thing but read/write again and again everytime a single operation is done
- this is good bcoz robust
- bad becoz VERY slow and nonscalable. 

Next method is in the file, instead of reading/writing everything, save the commands themselves. This will allow you to not write everything, but just append to the end of the file the new commands. Again we can do this in two flavours, either add after every user operation, or add at the end. (or maybe add at certain time intervals — maybe by having a separate Thread for this instead of doing on the main process thread). 
- Robust, user doesn’t lose information
- Writing is fast since we are appending new information instead of rewriting everything.
- Reading is costly becoz we read all operations performed before instead of all tasks. This is not an issue now since per task we can do atmost 3 operations — insert, markAsDone and remove. so #operations = O(#tasks). But this might not be so always. 
- Reading the first time is also costly, but not prohibitively so.

I had a question (a bit tangential from the main post, really sorry for that). I checked @CharlesLee01 ’s code, there are two main methods one inside Duke and one inside Launcher. How does Java determine which main method to call? Secondly how does changing the ```mainClassName``` inside ```build.gradle``` help? If the main method is changed, shouldnt the entire program change? (ie, one was text-based vs one was UI based). 

Again, sorry for going on a tangent.

Essentially the thing is to remove everything that uses that particular class/variable whatnot. Safe delete is just deleting all occurences, and you have to manually change the places which uses that particular class/variable.

I think streams also help in writing lesser code? I personally find them very easy to manage. 
However some differences : 
- streams are lazy while loops are eager!
- while optimising your code, loops can be parallelised and vectorised by the compiler much more easily than streams

This seems not to be possible since it is essentially determined at compile time. So you can create a new jar file using a downgraded compiler version but I doubt it is possible to downgrade after the JAR has been created.

LOD says this is bad:
```
Class A {
   void doStuff(B b) {
       b.getC().doCStuff();
  }
}
Class B {
   C c;
   C getC() {
      return c;
  }
}
```
I can understand why that is the case, but on second thoughts I wonder when the above code is refactored in the following way, is it really better?
```
Class A {
   void doStuff(B b) {
       b.doCStuff();
  }
}
Class B {
   C c;
   void doCStuff() {
      getC().doCStuff();
  }
}
```
Pros
- If calling `doCStuff` method is common, then `b.doCStuff()` is more convenient than having to use `b.getC().doCStuff()` all the time.

Cons
- Sometimes it may not feel right to have such a `doCStuff` method within class B?

I remember the times when I have to explain why I would prefer and recommend the first approach to the second approach but was not able to come up with an elegant explanation. 
Namely:
- Why do `List&gt;Integer> tags = new ArrayList&gt;>();` instead of `ArrayList&gt;Integer> tags = new ArrayList&gt;>();`
- Why do `Set&gt;Tag> tags = new HashSet&gt;>();` instead of `HashSet&gt;Tag> tags = new HashSet&gt;>();`

Interface segregation principle (ISP) seem like one of the good reasons to use to explain this preference.
>No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

So like the example mentioned in the textbook, we may want to avoid depending on concrete implementations of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) such as `ArrayList` and `HashMap` if we are not using any specific methods relating to those classes. Instead, we should use `List/Map/Set` interfaces.

Hope this helps if you ever need to explain it 👀

The `BankSystem` expects `Account` to throw an exception if `i` is not within the range of 0 to 100 (both exclusive). While B is definitely correct and C is definitely wrong, I feel uncomfortable saying that A follows LSP.
- if `i` is 100, `BankSystem` expects `Account` to throw an exception, but `AccountTypeA` will not.
- Perhaps an alternative example will be more suitable? 
  - method `Boolean hasAccount(int i)` will return true if  0 &gt; i &gt; 1000, return  false otherwise. 
  - `AccountTypeA` returns true if  0 &gt; i &gt; 1000, false otherwise, hence does not follow LSP

Hi guys, I was reading through the topics for this week and there was this **Bi-directional association** in the video, specifically:

Class `Box` has a `Lid` & Class `Lid` has a `Box`. (See screenshot below)


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41845017/110048595-1ae3e080-7d8b-11eb-94b7-8fc155eba00e.png)

Another similar situation is that sometimes we may want a quick way to pass a reference of the "producer" to the thing that is being "produced". For a slightly different example, one may have a `BookStore` class that contains a method that returns a `Book` as follows:
```java
class BookStore {
    // other details omitted
    Book randomBook() {
         return new Book(this, "The Great Gatsby");
    }
}
```
So in this case, while a `BookStore` may not have a direct association to `Book`, `BookStore` has a dependency on `Book` (correct me if I am wrong here). And `Book` has a direct association to `BookStore`
So in this case, `BookStore` points to `Book` (via dependency) and `Book` points to `BookStore` (via association). (Reading the textbook tells me that association is really just dependency.)

In gist, my question is:
Does it matter that we have a design that involves a bi-directional relationship between objects?
- Both objects are associated with each other.
- One is associated with the other while the other depends on the former.
- Both objects are dependent on each other.

Is it a situation where this is unavoidable, or that we should try to avoid it as much as possible, or it simply does not matter at all in terms of having good software design?

Hello, just browsing through the inherited TP code and I saw this weird line that invokes `super()` in the concrete implementation of the `Storage` interface, within the `StorageManager` class (line 23 -30):
```java
    /**
     * Creates a {@code StorageManager} with the given {@code AddressBookStorage} and {@code UserPrefStorage}.
     */
    public StorageManager(AddressBookStorage addressBookStorage, UserPrefsStorage userPrefsStorage) {
        super();
        this.addressBookStorage = addressBookStorage;
        this.userPrefsStorage = userPrefsStorage;
    }
```
While I understand that calling `super()` invokes the parent constructor, in this particular case, it seems to do nothing? 
P.S. I Googled it and found this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21181125/super-constructor-if-there-is-no-super-class) which seems to confirm my suspicion. Wonder if anyone knows of any other reason why the `super()` is there?

<panel  header="**10. :fas-info-circle: Interfaces: when and why?**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/176" expanded>

Hi guys, recently I had quite a few discussions with others on interfaces and why do we need them. 

Browsing through our textbook doesn't seem to provide me with adequate reasons why interfaces are needed. I acknowledge that interfaces do the job of specifying certain common behaviours that classes can share and allow for (multiple) inheritances and expressing is-a relationship in OOP fashion. However, it seems that besides multiple inheritances, abstract classes can do the job of interfaces just as perfectly. Also while researching for an answer, I found a casual comment by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) in one of his videos that interfaces are a lousy way of solving multiple inheritance issues in Java.

If I may quote some discussions that came up in my TP team chat:
"only good for implementations like list, collection etc" @ong6
"interface ... enforces methods on whoever implements them so it's like a safeguard?" @tjtanjin 
and myself:
"I think the use of interfaces is more when you have client-facing code, example a manufacturer will probably provide interfaces that tell software companies that want to make compatible software for this hardware that it needs to implement the certain interface in order to make the parts move etc"

At the end of it, I am not convinced and also not sure if the above discussions do justice to what interfaces are really for.  Other possible reasons that I know of are that interfaces seem to be important for inverting dependencies and also the principle of programming to an interface.

So my questions are:
Can someone provide a succinct example to illustrate why do we need to use interfaces? And if we do, why not go with abstract classes??

Hi guys, I am trying to update the developer guide of our team repo and I am faced with an issue.

Suppose now that I have done the task of `remove all irrelevant content of the developer guide inherited from AB3`, and I created a PR from my `update-developer-guide` branch. Now while waiting for my teammates to approve it, I want to start working on adding user stories to the developer guide. Should I 

1.work on a new commit that is under the existing PR branch (`update-developer-guide`)? 
Or
2.create a new branch (`update-developer-guide-user-stories`) and make my changes there?

My concern with No.1 is that if I have completed my second task of updating user stories before the PR gets merged, the PR will then complete two tasks (remove irrelevant content and add user stories). Not sure if this is fine and I will also need to update the PR description. And if the PR gets merged before I complete my second task, I will make another PR will the existing branch, not sure if this is a good practice.

My concern with No.2 is that I might potentially have to make multiple branches trying to do similar things, not sure if this is a good practice.

Any thoughts on the above or if you would like to share your workflow? Thanks in advanced!

In this case you might just call System.exit() only.

You are right about not needing to have both:) I have tested and can confirm that having just `Platform.exit()` works. And as mentioned by @vevek and @samuelfangjw , having just `System.exit(0)` works as well. 

According to the stackoverflow post, I believe calling `Platform.exit()` might be more suitable for cases where we still want to execute some pre-shutdown, perhaps non JavaFX related operations, other than that it shouldn't make any difference(cmiiw).

Thanks guys for contributing to this discussion. I think I overlooked the details when I thought about the issue, which I will now add below the extracted statements from sources that I just found:
- If no constructor is defined in a class, Java compiler automatically create a no-argument (no-arg) constructor, that simply issues a super() call
- The default no-arg constructor will not be automatically generated, if one (or more) constructor was defined. In other words, you need to define no-arg constructor explicitly if other constructors were defined.
- If the immediate superclass does not have the default constructor (it defines some constructors but does not define a no-arg constructor), you will get a compilation error in doing a super() call. Note that Java compiler inserts a super() as the first statement in a constructor if there is no super(args).
- Java guarantees that the constructor method of a class is called whenever an instance of that class is created. It also guarantees that the constructor is called whenever an instance of any subclass is created. In order to guarantee this second point, Java must ensure that every constructor method calls its superclass constructor method. Thus, if the first statement in a constructor does not explicitly invoke another constructor with this() or super(), Java implicitly inserts the call super(); that is, it calls the superclass constructor with no arguments. If the superclass does not have a constructor that takes no arguments, this implicit invocation causes a compilation error. docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/jnut/ch03_04.htm

I will just walk through this example from a StackOverflow post, to convince myself of this fact that I am unaware of until today:sweat:
```java
public class Base {
   public Base(int foo) {
   }
}

public class Subclass extends Base {
   public Subclass() {
      super(15);
   }
}
```
If the constructor of `Subclass` does not include the `super(15)` call, Java will implicitly insert `super()` in the first line of the constructor, which will cause an issue in the case where the `Base` class does not have an parameter-less constructor(`Base()`), which unfortunately will not be automatically generated because there is an existing constructor(`Base(int foo)`).

I think remembering the parameters and also their orders of a function is one of those things that can confuse and trip people up fairly easily. Having optional parameters at the end could possibly reduce that as we generally have a more instinctively understanding that parameters when listed, usually should be included unless stated otherwise. And when parameters are optional, they tend to be listed at the end. (Of course, one alternative to this, like what is typically done in Flutter, is to use named parameters).

Therefore, for example, for those who just want to use a function, they can quickly read through your documentation of the method and see that the first two parameters meet their needs and the last (third) parameter is optional,  and then they can go ahead and call the functions with the two parameters accordingly. In this case, they can totally "forget" about the existence of the optional parameter and still invoke the function correctly. However, if the function has an optional parameter in the middle, even if people want to simply invoke the function without the use of the optional parameter, they need to keep that optional parameter in mind and actively take note of the order of parameters to include, so as to avoid putting the parameters in the wrong place.

Just my 2 cents.

> It's usually a case of pros and cons. So, what are the benefits of bi-directional associations?

For cons:
- Cyclic dependencies make it hard to test as both classes need to know that the other class exists and is compilable.
- Changes in one class might break the other class.

For pros:
- The remotely plausible reason that I can think of is that having two smaller classes (even though in a bi-directional relationship) is at least better at closely modeling the interaction and real-life relationships between the two objects, as compared to one large class, hence more OOP?
- Convenient.

cons:
- Less convenient and potentially require more checking to ensure updates are made to reflect the new state of the program.

For the first part, I interpret what you are trying to do as follows:
- make a list of enum types
- check if the user input is valid if it is within the list of enums

On top of the suggestion given by @tjtanjin, maybe I will just add an alternative to achieve the above result if you use streams and make the enum like this:
```java
enum ResidenceAbbreviation{
    PGPH("PGPH"),
    PGPR("PGPR"),
    // and others

    private String text;

    ResidenceAbbreviation(String text) {
        this.text = text;
    }

    public String getText() {
        return this.text;
    }
}
// testing
String test = "userInput";

Arrays.stream(ResidenceAbbreviation.values())
      .map(ResidenceAbbreviation::getText)
      .anyMatch(x -&gt; x.equals(test));

After using it myself and also with @tjtanjin, I think draft PR is a good way to inform your teammates that you are working on certain tasks/features and this might save some typing (as an automatic email will be sent to notify everyone about the PR).
One possible drawback is that whenever a commit is updated in the draft PR, an email will be sent to your teammates as well. This might be deemed as unwarranted/unnecessary noise to some.

Since CI has been setup, we should have a decent amount of confidence that if it passes, that should imply that there are no breaking changes unless the PR disabled some test code or broke the test code itself, which is quite evident when looking at the code. Of course all these are on the assumption that there exists sufficiently good amount of test code. And this method is more suitable for individuals familiar with most of the code to know how one component might affect another or at least is well-versed in the particular area being changed.

In this case, if additional test code is written to verify the PR, we can also make use of the feature of GitHub that allows us to push directly to the branch of the PR and complement the PR (do inform the PR author though). IMO the time taken is actually worthwhile for especially for larger changes to the code base when more tests are written for it in the process.

I think you made a good point about having relevant test codes which will prove that PRs that passed the CI checks are, at the very least, worth reviewing. In terms of reviewing PRs, I personally feel that if the changes are non-critical and easily verifiable(for example documentation updates), it is possible to go with the first approach after a cursory check. As for the second approach, it is more suitable when changes are dense and the points mentioned in the PR message are hard to confirm with mere eye power.
That said, I think this brings out the importance of having a proper PR message that conveys the changes, the reasons behind them, and any note-worthy points. If such a message comes along with the PR, it will become a good checklist for PR reviewers to know what to expect.

Hi, I found the following rationale for Optional by Stuart Marks (a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Java Platform Group at Oracle) to be particularly insightful:
> Optional is intended to provide a **limited** mechanism for library method **return types** where there is a clear need to represent "no result", and where using null for that is **overwhelmingly likely to cause errors**.

In general, the consensus is that we should avoid using Optional in fields, method parameters, and collections. In your example, perhaps a default empty Remark object could be used for the remark field. 

As prof likes to say, it's about the pros and cons. While null is generally considered a bad idea, it has its place in certain scenarios where there is simply no better alternatives.

I think this is a great question and there's not much information in the textbook on the aspect of handling exceptions at which suitable level of abstraction. However, there is this statement from the textbook:
> Most languages allow code that encountered an "exceptional" situation to encapsulate details of the situation in an Exception object and throw/raise that object so that another piece of code can catch it and deal with it. This is especially useful when the code that encountered an unusual situation does not know how to deal with it.

I believe in our program, we typically throw exceptions that are ultimately resolved at a higher level of abstraction. For example (AB3), the LogicManager has a method `execute` as follows:
```java
public CommandResult execute(String commandText) throws CommandException, ParseException {
        logger.info("----------------[USER COMMAND][" + commandText + "]");

        CommandResult commandResult;
        Command command = addressBookParser.parseCommand(commandText);
        commandResult = command.execute(model);

        try {
            storage.saveAddressBook(model.getAddressBook());
        } catch (IOException ioe) {
            throw new CommandException(FILE_OPS_ERROR_MESSAGE + ioe, ioe);
        }

        return commandResult;
    }
```
There are two ways of handling exceptions displayed here. One is that it abstracted out a `parseCommand` method which throws `ParseException`. The `execute` method does not handle it but merely states that it throws `ParseException`, passing the work to yet another higher level of abstraction. In this case, it goes all the way up from LogicManager -&gt; MainWindow -&gt; CommandBox where the exception is handled as follows:
```java
/**
     * Handles the Enter button pressed event.
     */
    @FXML
    private void handleCommandEntered() {
        String commandText = commandTextField.getText();
        if (commandText.equals("")) {
            return;
        }

        try {
            commandExecutor.execute(commandText);
            commandTextField.setText("");
        } catch (CommandException | ParseException e) {
            setStyleToIndicateCommandFailure();
        }
    }
```
This is a case where the author (I'm guessing here) believes that `CommandBox` is the right place (as in appropriate and justifiable) to resolve the two exceptions. Hence, the classes along the execution path could simply pass along the exception without dealing with it.

If you look at LogicManager's `execute` method again, it resolves another type of exception: `IOException`. This is a case where the author (I'm guessing here) believes that it is the job of `LogicManager` to handle the exception created when saving data into storage.

I believe that handling exceptions at the right level of abstraction is not an easy task. 
Let's see what Prof & others' insights are 👀

Hi everyone, one of my application features is to allow the user to enter which residence the user stays at on campus. The input must be one of the allowed values, which I is what I did originally

However, my teammate told me it is bad design to compare strings like that, and told me to use enums instead. So it is now like this

I have read the discussion over at #14 and I would like to ask

1) Is the use of enums even worthwhile here? Given that it adds much verbosity to the code. Maybe I could simply declare all the strings as `static final`? 
2) How best should I do it? Currently I use the` Enum.valueof` to convert input strings to enums. However, this throws an `IllegalArgumentException` which I need to catch and then throw another exception to display an error message if the input is incorrect. When I do this, I get an error which says `incompatible thrown types ParseException in functional expression`. Basically, functional expressions cannot throw a checked exception. The exception is caused by this

Hi all, I changed the `@Override equals()` method in Person.java, after adding several new fields to the class. The purpose was to update the `equals()` method so that it will account for the new fields when comparing instances. However, that also causes some of the existing tests to not work, and I really don't understand why.

The image here shows what happens. Line 150 is `assertEquals(expectedModel, model);`

I ran in debug mode and I found that the fields of the Person instance were the same for both `expectedModel` and `model`. 

<img width="700" alt="is same" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46418515/110357953-d00de580-8076-11eb-966e-daa7bbaac06a.PNG">


So I am really not sure why this is happening, especially since this didn't happen when I didn't update the `equals()` method, even after I had added the new fields.

Hi everyone, in the AB3 command "ADD", there is an optional parameter for the command called "TAGS", which is the last one in the command string.

<panel  header="**10. :fas-info-circle: IP Grading Questions**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/130" expanded>

Hi everyone, I have a question about the IP grading since the deadline is next week. I have a few doubts, and I would like to clarify them now.

1) Regarding the IP requirements: Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe what happens is that the grader(is it script or human?) will click on the tag associated with the particular requirement and grade that branch according to the requirement at that time. As long as the requirement is met,  it counts towards the Implementation component. 

2) What if I implemented something imperfectly at that point in time, but made changes and corrected it much later? I know it is possible to move the tags, but I'm not sure if I should move a Level-2 tag, to, say, after Level-10. 

3) Will the overall submission be looked at, at all? Or rather, what is the role of the overall submission? 

EDIT: 4) Another question I have is, I only just realised that I have not been 100% following the git commit conventions. How will this impact my grading, since more than half of the commit messages are not exactly correct? Specifically, I added a full stop at the end of every commit message subject.

EDIT: 5) One big nagging question is also regarding handling exceptions. Initially before the GUI was added, one could read the exceptions since the app and the exceptions were both shown in the command line. However now with the GUI, the user would not be able to see the error messages, which is a bit unsettling to me, although I am not aware of any requirement to implement this. Am I right to say that handling exceptions as it were is acceptable?

I think I will have more, but these are the ones in my head at the moment. Thank you.

@damithc Thank you for your reply. I have a much better idea now. The question then is: How are these roles allocated? It is not as though all of us already have a very deep knowledge of that area with rich experiences. 

This also leads to my original concern, how should they be represented in the AboutUs? I know the obvious answer is "Just list whatever you did" but the reality could possibly be more complex. People might disagree about contribution levels, for example, and insist that they take on a certain role/responsbility as well. Would it be possible in this case, for multiple roles/responsibilities to appear as shared?

My question is: 

How best should I do it? Currently I use the `Enum.valueof` to convert input strings to enums. However, this throws an `IllegalArgumentException` which I need to catch and then throw another exception to display an error message if the input is incorrect. When I do this, I get an error which says incompatible thrown types `ParseException` in functional expression. Basically, functional expressions cannot throw a checked exception. The exception is caused by this method reference

I have tried to remove the method reference and explicitly pass the functional interface, however I ran into trouble with that as well. Now compiler complains that `initialData` might not be initialized. This is in the `MainApp` class

The thing is the file is always created with respect to ip directory, not with respect to wherever the java file/jar file directory is. 
So when I do `..` it actually went out of ip into the parent folder of ip, which is probably the main problem hahahaha

For the fragment of code you showed in your first post, I believe you might get something if you add `stage.show()` right after `stage.setScene()`. If it is convenient and you would like to you can give it a try. Otherwise if the issue is already resolved that's great too :D

Hmm yea in the end I went and did that in Main.class and it worked, that's why I was confused as to why it didn't work in MainWindow

My take is that If an exception is thrown then the lack of a return statement should not matter. So I guess your problem at hand is with assertions. Since assertions are not meant to be recoverable and indicates a bug to be fixed, it should not be triggered at all if the code is correctly written. If it is expected to occur then an exception should have been thrown in order to be caught. Using `assert false` in default case or else blocks is equivalent to not using it since assertions can be disabled. So ideally your code should have a happy path that always returns something valid, assertions are there to help you catch unexpected bugs when assertions are enabled.

For the oracle tutorial, they are using enums, which should only take on a limited number of values in which all of them should have a switch case, the only time that the assertion occurs is when a new enum value is added but not handled. This is a good scenario to use assertions since it indicates that the code needs to be updated. Furthermore, the switch case does not return, so presumably there will be a happy path below to handle the returning. For your example, you might want to explain the rationale behind asserting and catching that very same assertion when it can be handled all within the same else block. I would assume if the `command` is invalid, a parsing exception should either be raised like for the banana scenario since it is not to be handled by the `parseCommand` method, or there is a default `Fruit` to be returned instead.

I took a brief look at your iP code, I assume that the relevant part of your code in in `Parser.java`, namely the `Parser::parseRemainder` right? Do correct me if I am wrong. My understanding of exceptions is that it is thrown when something out of the norm has occurred, and it is something that the current method that is throwing the exception should not be able to handle. Hence throwing an exception will skip the rest of the execution and raise it through the call stack for it to be caught. If the current method can handle the issue, then an exception should not be thrown, it can be handled directly at the place where the exception is thrown. 

I understood your point of not returning a default object since there's none for this case, so throwing an exception to be caught by the call stack makes a lot of sense, since an exception during parsing indicates no valid return value, and hence the method calling `Parser::parseRemainder` ideally should catch this exception and be able to handle it, i.e. printing the error message.

(Exception throwing is quite literal, it's about throwing the problem to someone else, so I don't have to handle it)

Your branch-A-Assertions share a common history as your master branch, differing only by the merge and undo commit, hence there is nothing to be merged into master. For this case, it is easier to just undo your last 2 commits and do a force push on your master branch.

it is just a local branch named as "revert/CSmortal/branch-A-Assertions", before doing any reverts it is just a 1:1 copy of your master branch, after the revert commit if you didn't also push the local branch but only merged the revert branch, you won't be able to see the branch on the remote.

There shouldn't be a need to run the program using `sudo`, based on the error message, it is likely that your `DISPLAY` environmental variable has been configured wrongly somehow in your setup. By running `echo $DISPLAY` should tell you what the current value is. To override it temporarily, try something like `DISPLAY=:0 java -jar duke.jar`, change the `:0` to something other than the current value.

I think this [post](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/284903/reusing-a-merged-branch-good-practice) sums things up pretty well in terms of reusing branches. Reusing branches introduces needless complications that git intends to solve by make branching cheap and simple.

Following advice from [here](https://deepsource.io/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/), and since we are recommended to use the issue tracker to manage task delegation as well, it feels much simpler to name a branch along the lines of `50-update-userguide-add-command`, where 50 is the issue number.

Thanks for the tip, however, I'm a little confused, is this directed towards a workflow other than the [forking workflow](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/gitAndGithub.html#forking-workflow)? Because if we were to follow the forking workflow and make use of PRs, it is unlikely that we merge any PR outside of the web interface. Though I do see a use for this if the team is not using PRs and creates feature branches directly on the team repo instead.

From my point of view, I don't see much value in the merge commit when merging upstream to one's fork, given that this merge commit does not serve much purpose since we do not touch the `master` branch on both the team repo and our own fork, the two `master` branches should ideally be identical. It is unlikely that one will want to undo the merge from upstream to their own fork. For the case of undoing a merged PR, my understanding is that the merge commit for the PR is already sufficient to perform `git revert`.

As for branches themselves, my preference is to always rebase onto the latest master instead of merging master into the feature branch. The advantage of rebasing the feature branch is that it avoids the numerous merge commits that is rather meaningless and clutters the commit history instead, also that means keeping up with the latest master frequently while working on a big feature is possible and help show conflicts earlier. A linear history might prove to be useful down the line when trying to identify bugs using tools like `git bisect`. Of course even with that said, rebasing should be avoided once the feature is submitted for PR review.

Just my 2 cents on this matter, do correct me if any of my understanding is wrong.

Edit: Found this [article](https://timwise.co.uk/2019/10/14/merge-vs-rebase/) that sums things up pretty well.

I think the more suitable solution for this solution is `git switch branch-name`, which will automatically track the remote branch. `git switch` is a relatively new command that in general offloads the branching related tasks of `git checkout` and makes things less confusing while also being more intuitive sounding.

> The first method is obviously faster but prone to bugs since if no checks are done in the application itself, we might not know if someone's change broke anything.

I feel that this point would largely go away with sufficient amount of test code. Since CI has been setup, we should have a decent amount of confidence that if it passes, that should imply that there are no breaking changes unless the PR disabled some test code or broke the test code itself, which is quite evident when looking at the code. Of course all these are on the assumption that there exists sufficiently good amount of test code. And this method is more suitable for individuals familiar with most of the code to know how one component might affect another or at least is well-versed in the particular area being changed.

> The second method is more meticulous but takes up significantly more time especially if the PR is large.

Even in the second method, without test code there will be no sure way to know if the changes broke anything just by manually testing, test code is still necessary to formally verify. In this case, if additional test code is written to verify the PR, we can also make use of the feature of GitHub that allows us to push directly to the branch of the PR and complement the PR (do inform the PR author though). IMO the time taken is actually worthwhile for especially for larger changes to the code base when more tests are written for it in the process. Some examples would include major refactoring or restructuring of the code.

All in all, having relevant test code in place still feels like the key to approving PRs. Without them, I highly doubt it is any different from merging without any review unless the reviewer is an expert with special abilities to simulate the code. Not sure what others think.

> Not sure if immediately rethrowing Exceptions is a good practice.

To quote from the [textbook](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/errorHandling.html#how)

> The exception handler chosen is said to catch the exception.

Since exceptions can automatically propagate through the call stack, any method catching it should be in charge of handling it instead of throwing it again. In a similar fashion to the example @tlylt mentioned, the refactoring should be as follows:

```
public void method() throws SomeException {
    handleBadOutcome(isBadOutcome);
    ...
}

private void handleBadOutcome(boolean isBadOutcome) throws SomeException {
    // some attempts to recover before throwing exception, sets isBadOutcome to false if resolved
    if (isBadOutcome) {
        throw new SomeException();
    }
}
```

While using SLAP for this scenario, `handleBadOutcome` is more of a helper function of sorts to achieve SLAP and not exactly an abstraction in the sense of having different responsibility. In this case I believe we can just view both method like they are at the same level of abstraction and not see the original method as a higher level that should catch it.

The way git works is not simply to see the difference between the heads of the different branches to be merged, to put it in a simplified way, it will find the commits on the feature branch you're trying to merge that isn't available on the `v1.3` branch of your team repo. The difference in commits and use those difference to generate the list of files that has changed. In this case, upon the first merge of PR no. 174, all the commits on your feature branch are now a part of the team repo's `v1.3` branch. By performing a git revert, it does not actually remove those commits, it creates a set of changes that negates the changes introduced by the merging of PR no. 174. It is done this way to preserve history and forward-moving, thus there is no rewrite of public history. 

Back to the question as to why you can't create a PR on the same feature branch, it is because there's no commits on the feature branch that isn't on the `v1.3` branch of your team repo. To be able to reintroduce those changes, you need to revert the revert. Yes it sounds confusing but you need to create a PR that reverts PR no. 175 instead. 

Edit: Just realised your team has a different workflow that merges to a separate `v1.3` branch instead of master, be sure to protect that branch too to prevent accidental mergers.

An automatic git revert cannot be perform because of merge conflicts due to the newer commits. In this case, you can just branch from `v1.3` and perform the git revert locally and resolve the merge conflicts to complete the revert. I'm not familiar with sourcetree so I can only provide you with the command to perform the revert: `git revert 3076a606`, in the case that you aren't familiar with using git via CLI, there's hints after entering the above command on what you should do to complete the revert.

**Background:**

I finished doing my parallel branches "branch-A-Assertions" and "branch-A-CodeQuality" for Wk 5 iP. Then I created a PR for ONLY 
"branch-A-Assertions" (my mistake), then merged the PR with the repo. Here is where I realised my mistake, so I followed this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6481575/undo-a-merge-by-pull-request) and did these steps to reverse the merge PR.

```
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/master -b revert/CSmortal/branch-A-Assertions
git revert -m 1 61720c8e5aa82d127e8eb6ee17e636e7e515d6b7
```

It's my first time using git fetch, so I'm not sure if `git fetch origin` did anything cuz there was no output when the command finished. After doing `git revert -m 1 61720c8e5aa82d127e8eb6ee17e636e7e515d6b7`, there were many unstaged files (not sure if this the expected behaviour), then I committed them with the commit message "revert merge pull request".

**Problem:**
So now I'm trying to create another PR from my remote's "branch-A-Assertions" to "master", but I get the issue mentioned in the title: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67994626/108364002-8462db80-7230-11eb-881e-50545e048d82.png)
After some toying around, my guess is that this local branch called "revert/CSmortal/branch-A-Assertions" is in someway equals (i'm not sure) to the remote branch "branch-A-Assertions", which explains the picture above. My question is ...

1.  What is this "revert/CSmortal/branch-A-Assertions" branch? Is it just a local branch thats why I can't see it on my remote repo? What is its relationship with the local and remote "branch-A-Assertions"
2.  What do I do now to create a PR from "branch-A-Assertions" to "master"?

@tjtanjin I tried restructuring the proj the way you mentioned. 

I assume this pic below confirms that "java" under src/main is the source root.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67994626/105957234-ea39c880-60b3-11eb-83cf-f4c9ee42b865.png)


Strangely under the same "Project Structure>Project Settings>Modules" window, "java" under src/test is not marked as test sources root, when I have already done so on the left pane of intellij to mark it as the test sources root, and appears green as well.

Under the same window, i tried setting "java" under src/test as the test sources root and i get this issue when applying changes.

And lastly, the imports are all messed up and idk how to solve it. In Deadline.java, it doesn't know what Task is (like IntelliJ doesnt give me the option to import Task but they belong to the same package anw so why is this happening?), and ParserTest.java under test.java.duke has no option to import the classes in main.java.duke

@tjtanjin changing my package statements for all my java files to `package duke;` still doesn't allow me to import the relevant classes within the same package. 

I just wanna check if I'm marking each directory correctly:

Does this window confirm that the `java` folder within the `main` folder is the source root?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67994626/106102954-22580e80-617b-11eb-9dbe-21c364440588.png)

 The left pane on IntelliJ isn't very helpful cuz it just shows the whole thing `main.java.duke` without allowing me to right click on `java` to check what it is marked as. So i just resorted to the Project Structure window that comes up after pressing Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S above
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67994626/106103319-ba55f800-617b-11eb-9a72-b2973cae38a5.png)

Also, I'm kinda confused why both `src/test` and `src/test/java` are both test sources roots, after i followed @ypinhsuan instructions. Is this intended? I'm reading up on what modules in IntelliJ are but im rly confused on what they are.

Ah shucks, i forgot that i need to change the package statement for ALL of the java files.

**I no longer have the "No Tests were found" error!**. It seems like the issue was with the coexistence of the `ip` and `main` module, where i believe my `test` module had `ip` as its dependency, which caused issues with making `src/main/java` the source root. 

@w2vgd I created the `main` module after the `ip` module, and then i later deleted the `ip` module.

Cn I ask why exactly if the content root (im assuming this is just the root of a module) of `ip` is `src`, and if I had no `main` module, then why does the error occur (where the `test` module has `ip` module as its dependency)?

@tjtanjin I tried adding `testCompile("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-params:5.7.0")` to the dependencies section of the build.gradle. Not sure what I had to do next so I went to the relevant java file and tried to see if the tag `@ParameterizedTest` is recognised, still doesnt work.

@chewterence 
for your 1st method that `throws CommandNotFoundException`, what if i didnt want the method to throw any exception, like if i wanted to handle any exceptions in this method, i.e.
```
public Fruit parseCommand(String command) {
    try {
        switch (command) {
        case "apple":
            return new Apple();
        case "banana":
            return new Banana();
        default:
            throw new CommandNotFoundException();
        }
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Do something
    }
}  
```

I think this will have compile errors since the "missing return statement" error appears. I'm more certain this appears for if/else blocks instead of switch statement.


As an example of the issue in my code, the situation looks something like this:
```
public Fruit parseCommand(String command) {
    try {
        if (command == "apple") {
            return new Apple();
        } else if (command == "banana") {
            throw new Exception("what is a banana?");
        } else {
            assert false : "You shouldn't reach this block";
        }
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Do something
    }
    
    return null;
}
```

In the code above, I'm assuming the command can only be `"apple"` or `"banana"`, so I'm trying to test that assumption with this code here. One else if block doesn't have a return statement, but even if it does, i still get the issue of "missing return statement" if i dont include the `return null` after the try catch block. And for the reason why i put the `assert false` statement in the else block, following [this assertions tutorial in Wk5 topics,](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html) in the Suits example with the part on "Internal Invariants", it says we should test the assumption that the suit variable is one of the four types, so thus we should put a `assert false` statement in the default case of switch statement (and by extension the else block for if else blocks). So, regarding what @kouyk said about assertions "should not be triggered at all if the code is correctly written", I don't think his way should be the approach to writing assertions. Following the link, we should be testing assumptions, not riding on them.

> agree with @w2vgd that it is too hasty to conclude default cases and else clause should be used solely for throwing exceptions/errors. Printing in the default case can help debugging(to affirm that the switch clause is reached) since there can be new cases as we add new features to a software.
> Personally, I have used switch clauses in non-void methods, and I find no issue in the return statements as the default clause is never reached. Maybe you can consider handling all cases in the switch clause so the default case will never be reached? Variables can be declared as `Integer count;` instead of `Integer count = null;`

@candyhy I'm not very familiar with throwing and switch statements, but if you're enumerating all your cases ( not using the default case as your last case to handle the last possible input to the switch statement ), unless your method that contains the switch statement explicitly throws something in its method declaration, your default case should cause the "missing return statement" if it does not have a return statement. Please correct me if I'm wrong

> 
> 
> For the oracle tutorial, they are using enums, which should only take on a limited number of values in which all of them should have a switch case, the only time that the assertion occurs is when a new enum value is added but not handled. This is a good scenario to use assertions since it indicates that the code needs to be updated. Furthermore, the switch case does not return, so presumably there will be a happy path below to handle the returning. For your example, you might want to explain the rationale behind asserting and catching that very same assertion when it can be handled all within the same else block. I would assume if the `command` is invalid, a parsing exception should either be raised like for the banana scenario since it is not to be handled by the `parseCommand` method, or there is a default `Fruit` to be returned instead.

@kouyk Ok so assuming its not enums, and each case in the switch statement returns something, then the solution to escape the "missing return statement" should be a happy path, or a default "Fruit" returned in the case of the parseCommand() method? Because the relevant code in my iP doesn't have a happy path (its checking what the input is "==" to, not checking against some boolean condition or smth), and i dont want to return a default object.

@kouyk yup, thats the code I'm having the issue with. So after reading Prof @damithc 's comment, for `Parser::parseRemainder()`, should I be including a `throws Exception` in its method signature, then remove the try catch block in the method, then I will no longer have the "missing return statement" error if i exclude the `return null`?

thanks all, can I also ask when should I use assert statements over throwing AssertionError()? The oracle docs shows AssertionError would be better for those Internal Invariants situations and for the same issue of "missing return statement" error inside a non void method. Coupled with java disabling assertions by default, I can't see when to use simple assert statements.

I added in the tp such that deletion of tasks can be done in 1 command, i.e something like `delete 1 2 3`

This is how the `parseCommand` method in the class that my group has renamed from `AddressBookParser` looks like

This is the `parseMultipleIndex` method that would be called in the `parse` method of `DeleteMultipleCommandParser`, if `hasMultipleValidIndex()` is true (see the first pic)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67994626/111896992-5b647f00-8a58-11eb-9a53-9d1d6549278f.png)

I wrote the code as such, because i didn't want `parseMultipleIndex` to depend heavily on `hasMultipleValidIndex`. But after looking at it again, I thought if it would be better to throw an AssertionError in both of the 2 condition checks in `parseMultipleIndex`, since it was checked for previously in `hasMultipleValidIndex`. But then I thought it might not be such a good idea since it "couples" these two methods together strongly.

My question is which approach is better for code quality? (Not sure if thats the term to use either)

Hi, was trying to do the tutorial (removing a field) for tp code base, just observed sth:

when I do the refactoring (removing the `phone` field of `Person`), the tutorial mentions it is better to [refactor the test data as well so that the old version does not accumulate](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp/tutorials/RemovingFields.html#tidying-up).

That part I have no problem with. But then I wonder whether we also need to refactor the json data under `[root]/data/`. According the `.gitignore`, that data file is not version controlled, which means if I delete the `phone` fields in the data file, then I switch to other branches, I would have issues loading data because some compulsory data field is missing.

Then, does it mean I should not edit that data file when refactoring? I understand **in this case** if I do not edit the data file the code would work for my working branches and other branches, but are there any possible implications (which will make refactoring the un-version-controlled data file necessary)?

If there are no such implications, it is clear that I should not refactor the un-version-controlled data file whenever I refactor my code. But I cannot get my logic correct here (either prove or give counter examples). Help needed. :)

Agreed. If I am not wrong you are saying there would be cases where there is a need to check whether the description **matches** the expected value, in this case, the String `"This is a dummy class."`. 

Just want to extend the discussion a little bit: normally we would have a lot of such static final field declarations in our application, then managing the 'expectations' would be quite troublesome already. I guess there would be some place/some way for us to manage what would be expected for the (important) static fields easily (e.g. instead of peeking at individual classes), but I have no clue : |. Anyone knows anything about it?

> I agree it's going to be huge hassle with lots of static final field declarations. Off the top of my head, I imagine for larger applications with lots of static final field declarations of string types, these strings may be stored/read from inside a `messages.yml` or `messages.json` file of sorts (has the added benefit of easy configuration/changing messages without directly editing the file containing code). It might then be possible to construct a single test class pertaining to all these messages which should at least centralise the testing and makes things slightly more organised. What do you think?

I used to think of putting important static messages in a doc or something equivelent. But yeah, using a `.json` or `.yml` file as a whole seems to be a much better idea. :D

For styling issues I would say no big difference. For performance issues mentioned above I would say streams can work parallel and can be more efficient compared to for-loop for a very big list of data. (But for small amount of data, yes, loop is usually more efficient.)

I used enums for the commands as well, but also had to do some manipulation to get the enum constant. I converted the input string to uppercase and used the `Enum.valueOf()` method to get the corresponding enum constant, catching the IllegalArgumentException that is thrown if the command is not valid.

In my opinion, I think it is fine to have a commit message with the same name as long as what the change is and why the change was made is clear. For example, a message such as "Fix typo in user guide" makes it very clear that we are fixing a typo because there was a mistake. 

However, I feel that "Update Automated UI Testing" does not clearly show why the change was made. In this case perhaps the context behind the change (e.g. to test for the list command) should be added to the body or the subject title so other users who are reviewing the code will get a better idea of why the commit was done without having to look through at the diffs page.

Agree with @vevek! Can confirm I used `System.exit(0)` and it works fine for me too. From this stack overflow [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12153622/how-to-close-a-javafx-application-on-window-close) seems like having both `Platform.exit()` and `System.exit(0)` may actually be unnecessary. Relevant comment: 

>I just want to point out that in this case the stop() method won't be called at all (at least with JavaFX 8 on windows) because System.exit() closes everything too early. In this case you might just call System.exit() only. But if you want to do something in the stop() method, I would recommend calling Platform.exit() here and System.exit(0) at the end of the stop() method if needed.

`CommandExecutor` is a functional interface. Functional interfaces have a single abstract method and we can declare them by assigning a lambda expression or method reference to them. 

In this case, we do not actually call the `executeCommand()` method to get the return result, we are just assigning the method to the `CommandExecutor` function interface and calling the constructor with the `CommandExecutor` object.

Perhaps writing this example as follows will make it more clear:
```java
CommandBox.CommandExecutor commandExecutor = this::executeCommand;
CommandBox commandBox = new CommandBox(commandExecutor);
commandBoxPlaceholder.getChildren().add(commandBox.getRoot());

[This link](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-functional-programming/functional-interfaces.html) explains functional interfaces a lot better than I can! It only shows lambda expressions being assigned to functional interfaces, but according to the [java 11 documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/package-summary.html) method references can be assigned as well.

> Thanks @samuelfangjw for the explanation. I think I understand now. Because method references are a special kind of lambdas, and functional interfaces can be instantiated with lambda expressions, `this::executeCommand` is just an instantiation of the `CommandExecutor` interface.

From the [official java tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html),  Method references "are compact, easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods that already have a name."

Hi there, can confirm the same tests are failing. I did some very light testing, the tests in `LogicManagerTest` work when run in isolation but do not work when run together with other tests. Seems like your application takes into account some kind of state when parsing commands, I believe the state is not being reset, causing the tests to fail.

Edit:
The tests also seem inconsistent for me. Running the tests multiple times, sometimes all tests  pass sometimes it fails.

In `LogicManagerTest`, I added the following line to reset the state to inactive before every test and the tests don't seem to be failing anymore.

```java
    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        JsonBookingSystemStorage bookingSystemStorage =
                new JsonBookingSystemStorage(temporaryFolder.resolve("bookingSystem.json"));
        JsonUserPrefsStorage userPrefsStorage = new JsonUserPrefsStorage(temporaryFolder.resolve("userPrefs.json"));
        StorageManager storage = new StorageManager(bookingSystemStorage, userPrefsStorage);
        logic = new LogicManager(model, storage);
        ModelManager.setStateInactive(); // added this line
    }
```

Seems like a short term band aid solution to the current problem though (shared state between tests).

Hi Prof @damithc, what if we had used enums earlier than the given order? 

In the instructions it states "Implement the following increments in the given order." where the given order was "Level-1, Level-2, Level-3, Level-4, A-TextUiTesting, Level-5, Level-6, A-Enums". However in my case it made sense to use enums before Level-6. In this case does the tag ordering matter?

As I understood it, deadlines should be paired with the "/by"  operator and not the "/at" operator. Hence the need for events. 

In my case for deadlines I specifically ensure that it requires a "/by". If there is no "/by" it should be a todo command instead and hence I also throw an error. So for the case of "deadline return book /at Sunday" I throw an error.

As said by the others, I prefer to use streams in areas where a traditional loop would become visually complex, and I can better hide this complexity through the use of streams. 

From [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44180101/in-java-what-are-the-advantages-of-streams-over-loops) on stack overflow, streams appears visually easier to understand, even in the case a simple loop.

```
**Traditional Loop:**
List<Person> filtered = new ArrayList<>();
 for(Person p : people) {
     if(p.age() < 19) {
         filtered.add(p);
     }
 }
 return filtered;
```

```
**Streams:**
return people
     .filter( p -&gt; p.age() < 19)
     .collect(toList());

If I recall you can right click the specific conflict to exclude it from safe delete. Although tedious, it would help avoid further issues down the line.

So after reading Prof @damithc 's comment, for 'Parser::parseRemainder()', should I be including a 'throws Exception' in its method signature, then remove the try catch block in the method, then I will no longer have the "missing return statement" error if i exclude the 'return null'?

Sounds correct. Also as @w2vgd has said, instead of asserting that the user has input a wrong command. It would be better to throw an exception and handle it. I would have done something similar to this:

''''
public Fruit parseCommand(String command) throws Exception {
    Fruit fruit;

    if (command == "apple") {
       fruit = new Apple();
    } if (command == "pear") {
       fruit = new Pear();
    } else if (command == "banana") {
        throw new Exception("what is a banana?");
    } else {
        // Should not be asserting here as this is a user error. Should throw an exception instead.
        throw new Exception("Invalid command etc");
    }

    return fruit;
}
''''

> thanks all, can I also ask when should I use assert statements over throwing AssertionError()? The oracle docs shows AssertionError would be better for those Internal Invariants situations and for the same issue of "missing return statement" error inside a non void method. Coupled with java disabling assertions by default, I can't see when to use simple assert statements.

Taken from stackoverflow:

Personally, I feel that pull request are a very good way to review and ensure that code being added to master branch is always in working order. 

Moreover, if another teammate begins working on a new feature from master, they start with a working master and not a potentially buggy one. If he started with a buggy master, it needlessly slows down his development on the feature he wants to work on. 

Lastly, if everyone works on the same branch, I think it would increase the amount of communication between those working on it, as a lot of coordination would be required.

For my team and I, we enabled an option in settings where every pull request has to be reviewed by someone other than the author of the pull request. We did this to help us ensure that each pull request is checked at the very least and there can be no hasty merges performed.  

This setting is available through these steps.
1. Under your repository
2. Select your repo's Settings 
3. In the left pane, select Branches
4. Under Branch Protection Rules, click Edit for Master
5. Under Protect Matching Branches, enable "Require Pull Request Reviews Before Merging"
6. Optionally enable "Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed"

For my team, we have set a **minimum of 1 review required**, as well as enabled the option to **"Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed"** where if you pushed new commits to the branch for the PR, the updated change would have to be reviewed again.

Testing it out on my projects md files, I found that like you said it did not matter whether a long line was used instead of one that is kept consistently below 120 characters.  

The only benefit I can think of is being able to copy & paste into the md file without spending too much time creating line breaks just to ensure that lines are kept below 120 characters. I would still prefer to keep each line below 120 characters as it is easier to edit and maintain.

I can think of 2 approaches to open pull requests:

1. Open only when ready (New feature/change fully implemented in branch + tests and checkstyle cleared)
2. Open as a **draft pull request** once you make a commit (Even if not fully implemented)

Personally, I think option 2 should be considered as it allows for teammates to see your progress as you implement whatever change you are assigned (so if you get stuck anywhere, someone might be able to offer advice early on). A reviewer could point out changes to consider implementing while developing a feature rather than wait until the assignee thinks the feature is finished before asking the assignee to go back and edit the code.

The only drawback I can think of is that there would be a lot more CI reports (including failing ones) generated.

Update: I just realised there are 2 JavadocMethod modules, one for public methods, one for non-trivial private methods...

And after I deleted both copies of allowMissingPropertyJavadoc, I got these, which I also successively deleted but gave up because I don't know if these are required for CheckStyle:
```
Property 'allowUndeclaredRTE' does not exist, please check the documentation
Property 'ignoreMethodNamesRegex' does not exist, please check the documentation

For mine, the config folder was separate from the src folder, but I somehow managed to get it to work. These are the Javadoc checkstyle properties that I kept:
```
      <property name="allowedAnnotations" value="Override, Test, BeforeAll, BeforeEach, AfterAll, AfterEach, Subscribe"/>
      <property name="scope" value="public"/>
      <property name="allowMissingParamTags" value="true"/>
      <property name="allowMissingReturnTag" value="true"/>
      <property name="tokens" value="METHOD_DEF, ANNOTATION_FIELD_DEF"/>
```

Everything else was deleted. Here's the full list of my deleted properties in original order for non-trivial private:
```
<property name="minLineCount" value="3"/>
<property name="allowUndeclaredRTE" value="true"/>
<property name="allowThrowsTagsForSubclasses" value="true"/>
<property name="allowMissingThrowsTags" value="true"/>
<property name="allowMissingPropertyJavadoc" value="true"/>
<property name="ignoreMethodNamesRegex" value="(set.*|get.*)"/>
```

And for public:
```
<property name="minLineCount" value="1"/>
<property name="allowUndeclaredRTE" value="true"/>
<property name="allowThrowsTagsForSubclasses" value="true"/>
<property name="allowMissingThrowsTags" value="true"/>
<property name="allowMissingPropertyJavadoc" value="true"/>
<property name="ignoreMethodNamesRegex" value="(set.*|get.*)"/>
```

After all these, I managed to get CheckStyle to run on both my main and test code. I'm keeping this issue open in case there's a more elegant solution without deleting these properties.

I headed to this link from the user guide, which I accessed from the Week 3 familiarise with AB3 tP task.

Edit: The CheckStyle file was updated to v8.32, but the build.gradle put 8.29. Not sure if I should change the build.gradle checkstyle to 8.32...

Edit 2: Ok, so what I did was download the production release v0.1 source code and get the checkstyle file from there. Maybe that explains why it's different from what's on Github...

If I may add on, another way to divide responsibilities would be to divide members based on administrative tasks like:
1. Overall IC for merging pull requests
2. Documentation IC 
3. Code Quality IC

My team splits work based on features but we also have members in charge of different components and administrative tasks.
E.g. One member has the following IC roles:

gitignore only prevents files that has not been tracked previously to be ignored from tracking.

As the gitignore file itself has been tracked in the past, the option would not be available and, as above, should continue to be tracked.

The FC command is actually similar to the Unix `diff` command that shows the differences between two files (in this case, the ACTUAL.TXT vs EXPECTED.TXT).

If you try to replace it with the full path of where the executable exists, does it work? (i.e. this is usually found in `C:\Windows\system32\fc.exe`)

From the file path and where you’re running the JAR from, I think the relative path there would imply that your duke.txt file is in: `...\Java\compileroutput\artifacts\ip_jar\src\data\duke.txt`, which I guess is not what you have set up? You can verify this if you create the src\data directory in ip_jar folder.

It looks like the file creation is failing because the src\data directory is not present in ip_jar folder. Which is why if you tried to create the aforementioned folders and it works, then you can implement the fixes that @tjtanjin has suggested :)

Personally, I don't think it's a good idea to commit compiled files unless there is a good reason for doing so. By definition, since git is primarily a version control tool, it makes sense to want to version control the source files instead of the compiled product.

Additionally, I believe you may run into issues with rebasing later on (if you have the need to do it) with the inclusion of compiled files.

Personally, I find that the second option would be good. What if the program crashes or encounters some other unrecoverable error before the save has happened? I think the efficiency of saving/deleting/modifying the file can be called into question as well when you have a larger number of Tasks.

Inadvertently, this does also raise the question of what happens if the user does the following "unsupported" task:
1. Save a Task
2. Delete the storage file
3. Try to save the task again

This will probably be classified as unsupported behavior and not an intended use of the application. However, should we as developers foresee these types of issues and attempt to make provisions for them?

> I think this would be handled as an IOException within the method responsible for saving tasks. Ideally the code should re-generate the missing folders/file if they are found to not exist but upon a failed creation (probably due to permission issues), it should terminate the entire program with a proper exit message.

That's true. I was considering this possibility because the way I implemented my add task function only appends the new task to the end of the opened file. 

If I were to re-generate missing file structures, then I would also need to consider adding previously existing tasks in the list to the file as well, otherwise, there will be a mismatch between what is in the file vs what is in the task list at run-time. This could cause problems as well if the user modifies a task added before the file was re-generated (e.g. mark a task as done in the application, and this task is present in memory but not present in the file on the user's hard drive). 

And there could be various more "unsupported" uses of the application or ways to break it like this that I hadn't really thought about as well.

I feel like think this is very situational and they are good for both scenarios. There are cases where streams are more readable than for/while/if, especially if there are many scenarios to be checked for, and writing a stream and collecting them could look much cleaner and readable. On a personal level, I'd use "traditional" for/while/if for simple checks and use streams if the loops are more complex.

But, it's also subjective. As you have pointed out, some of us are more comfortable with traditional loops as opposed to streams. One requirement may be to have code that's able to be maintained or better understood by others through the course of a project, and it may be necessary to adjust to that. Otherwise, personally, at the end of the day, as long as it gets the job done and conforms to coding standards and quality requirements, from a SE perspective I don't think there's a "right answer" unless there's a specific scenario in which it forces you to use one over the other.

The data in the `data/addressbook.json` is populated by the [sample data utility](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java) if it is not present, so I think if your working data is messed up later you could let it re-populate again later.

Personally, I did not remove the address field in the data file while doing the removing field tutorial since it's not in git and by nature it's fine for JSON files to have extra fields anyway (although maybe in an ideal scenario the software developer would code to remove unused fields in future revisions to patch if they are no longer necessary).

@damithc Hi prof, I'm having the same situation as @Hzxin so I think it's better for me to include in here also.

This merge and other merge of my pr has been done on Feb 25, but the tp dashboard does not update it for 2 days already. I wonder if any bug in the checking system or it's my fault somewhere. I also think that I have followed the step for the tp.

From what I know, there are 2 main ways one can go about checking and approving PR's:

1. We approve the PR by just looking at the files changed and see if the code looks good
2. We pull the PR locally, test it out and then after testing the PR and code changes related, approve it

The first method is obviously faster but prone to bugs since if no checks are done in the application itself, we might not know if someone's change broke anything. 

The second method is more meticulous but takes up significantly more time especially if the PR is large. 

Is there any recommended way to clearing PR's?

Wow, what a coincidence, I was thinking of this question as well. 

My take on this would be that avoiding bi-directional relationships is better since if you decide to change one class down the line, having a bi-directional relationship would cause a lot of issues. 

Also, oftentimes I feel that a bi-direction relationship can be easily represented with a unidirectional as well. So unless bi-direction is strictly required, I feel there is no need to use them.

Regarding the second part of your question, I think it is heavily dependent on what you're comfortable with. If you feel like there may be changes to some essential part of the code down the line, unit testing is definitely a better choice as it won't be too dependent on other parts of the code working. However, if you feel like you're close to completion, integration testing could be a good sanity check to see if different modules of your product are working.

Hi Nicholas! Here is my naive idea. Maybe you could choose to put the relative function into one class to simulate OOP. But I remember that the requirement of iP is to use OOP most. So you could consider changing the structure of your code and add more features about OOP. Hope this helps!

Hi @w2vgd, here is one of the explaination on google. Maybe you could refer to it.

> Java modules are the simplest module type and represent a basic Java application project, whether it's a command-line tool, a Swing application, or a JAR library. When configuring this type of module, you can specify a set of Java source paths that will be compiled to a single class folder. The basic capabilities of this module are carried over into the web module.

> The web module is an extension of the Java module that adds support for web applications. In addition to providing the ability to create and build Java sources, it lets you edit your web application's deployment descriptor, build and deploy it to your application server, and configure other web application capabilities. You create a web module for each web application in your project.

On my own opinion, it seems that it doesn't matter for this project. JAVA_MODULE is enough to satisfy the requirement since WEB_MODULE is an extension of the JAVA_MODULE and we don't need any web applications so far. Hope this works!

What stumped me is that it both asks that "The work comes from a source of 'good standing' (such as an established open source project)." and it gives provisions to "reuse code snippets found on the Internet e.g. from StackOverflow answers", which is not an established source.

In my case, I'm trying to use [https://stackoverflow.com/a/13564498/11358676](url) for code on Levenshtein distance, and I'm largely copying code wholesale. Can I use it as is, or should I instead use an established third party library like "Apache Commons Lang3"?

Dear all, 

I recently changed the package name of tp from seedu.address to seedu.sochedule. However, upon running the gradle for testing, I noticed that I have doubled test cases now. An screenshot for the test result has been attached at the back. 

Thus, can I check if this issue is relevant to my intellij setting or gradle or some other file?
Some possibilities ruled out:
1. I have checked that the test under seedu.address have disappeared and I only have on test folder under seedu.sochedule
2. For the build.gradle file, the only line changed is the mainappname as shown in the image below.

Alternatively, we may make use of the `.next()` from the `Scanner` object you have created. It automatically takes in the next String in the input, which is the command word in our case. Then, based on the command, we can carry out relevant steps, for example a `.nextLine()` to read in the rest of the line. 

However, I do agreee with @tjtanjin that his way of splitting may be more elegent during implementation:) Hope it helps in providing another perspective.

Maybe I can share a bit about how to move the tag to the future commits in case anyone is curious. Personally I find it easier to be done via SourceTree. It is essentially just **deleting the old tag and create a new one**:)

1. Click on the commit with the tag you wanted to move. 
2. Right click and click on tag to open the dialog where you created the tag.
3. Click on "remove tag" and select the tag you wish to change. I find it useful to also check the "remove tag for all remotes".

4. After removing the tags, just select the more recent commit and create the tag for it. And then your tag is **'moved'** there!
5. However, do note that these changes may **distort your ordering of tags** when u click on 'tags' page for your forked project on Github. For example, mine looks like this now T_T Even though the commit with tags "A-Enums", "level-2" and "level-4" are older than that for "A-TextUiTesting", these tags are still behind them.

Do you think it may be better to use &gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/ip/master/docs/Ui.png> as the url of the picture? Otherwise, maybe it woule be better to state explicitly in the instructions that we need to serve our `Ui.png` at &gt;https://USERNAME.github.io/ip/Ui.png>?

Using an HBox seems to be an interesting solution! I did it in a slightly different way.

I used a `javafx.scene.shape.Rectangle` as the dialog box. To print the message within the Rectangle, I wrapped both the message node and the Rectangle inside a `javafx.scene.layout.StackPane` which resizes automatically so that all its children are within its boundary. However, the Rectangle does not resize automatically. Therefore, what I did was ` rectangleNode.heightProperty().bind(stackPaneNode.heightProperty());` so that the Rectangle's height is always equal to the height of its parent StackPane.

One benefit of this method is that you can easily replace the Rectangle with any other shape (e.g. `javafx.scene.shape.Path`) without changing any other code.

A more complete Java code snippet:

```Java
Rectangle rectangleNode = new Rectangle(300.0, 20.0);
rectangleNode.setFill(Color.AQUA);

StackPane stackPaneNode = new StackPane();
stackPaneNode.getChildren().addAll(rectangleNode, messageNode);

rectangleNode.heightProperty().bind(stackPaneNode .heightProperty());
```

agree with @w2vgd that it is too hasty to conclude default cases and else clause should be used solely for throwing exceptions/errors. Printing in the default case can help debugging(to affirm that the switch clause is reached) since there can be new cases as we add new features to a software.
Personally, I have used switch clauses in non-void methods, and I find no issue in the return statements as the default clause is never reached. Maybe you can consider handling all cases in the switch clause so the default case will never be reached? Variables can be declared as `Integer count;` instead of `Integer count = null;`
Hope this helps! maybe you can consider showing us your code for more concrete help:)

> @candyhy I'm not very familiar with throwing and switch statements, but if you're enumerating all your cases ( not using the default case as your last case to handle the last possible input to the switch statement ), unless your method that contains the switch statement explicitly throws something in its method declaration, your default case should cause the "missing return statement" if it does not have a return statement. Please correct me if I'm wrong

@CSmortal 
If your cases handles all possible enums, and the default case will never be reached, then throwing an assertion error in the default case does not require an exception to be added to the method signature. In my opinion, throwing an assertion error in a default clause that shouldn't be reached makes sense. 

Attached below is an example of use of assertion error in default clause:

However, this scenario only applies when you can list out all possible case values, because assertions are meant to detect flaws in the programmer's code and not because of an invalid user input (this should be handled by exceptions). So as what Prof @damithc and @kouyk has mentioned, you may want to handle the exception in the calling parent method or just handle the issue directly at the place where the issue occurred.

Hi yes i later noticed that the checkstyle tests have been passed. Based on your error messages, I believe it could be a type issue.

I've tried deleting the .ideas files or resetting workspace.xml but none of these worked. My teammates are still able to run the app as usual so I suspect there's something wrong with my Intellij.

I have resolved the issue, it's because I did not install packages such as jdk11 or dos2unix under my WSL but only on Windows. Some learning points for people who might also face such issues under WSL:

If the output says command not found, navigate to that specific line and run that command in your WSL to see what is the issue. Most of the time the system will tell you where to look for solutions.

@damithc, since this seems to be a module-wide behaviour.

## The change

Our group recently refactored our tP documentation structure in a series of commits ['4df1103'](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/commit/4df1103d76c5273f1f2c77c6d5e986c5b262b8c2)...['73947a7'](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/tree/73947a7f2a5db30bb91a469cb3ac3f10ac258164).
Essentially we changed the hierarchy of documents from:

'''
docs
+-- DeveloperGuide.md
+-- Configuration.md
+-- ...
+-- UserGuide.md
'''

to the following, to abstract content away from the structure of the developer guide:

'''
docs
+-- developer
|   +-- Configuration.md
|   +-- ...
+-- developerGuide
|   +-- architecture
|   |   +-- Logic.md
|   |   +-- ...
|   +-- feature
|   |   +-- Add.md
|   |   +-- ...
|   +-- ...
+-- DeveloperGuide.md
+-- UserGuide.md
'''

Sample code snippet of ['DeveloperGuide.md'](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/blame/4df1103d76c5273f1f2c77c6d5e986c5b262b8c2/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#L18-L26) after refactoring:

'''
### Architecture

{\% include_relative developerGuide/architecture/index.md %\}'

The sections below give more details of each component.

{\% include_relative developerGuide/architecture/Ui.md %\}

{\% include_relative developerGuide/architecture/Logic.md %\}
'''

## The problem

This had the unintended effect of removing the progress check marks on the [dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/dashboards/contents/tp-progress.html) for group members, since the grading scripts seem to only capture changes and regenerates statistics only based on the git blame of specific files '/docs/developerGuide.md' and '/docs/UserGuide.md' in the latest commit of the 'master' branch:

Sample 1:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28663438/113467234-577f2680-9474-11eb-9ad3-2546ddf50481.png)

Sample 2:

## Proposed fixes

Would it be possible to add an exception to the grading scripts for progress prior to week 12 to track based on the commit ['3ef2209'](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/tree/3ef2209a730b28a6b57338bd447a4c48fcd4622b/docs) immediately before the refactoring? Otherwise what would be the recommended next step forward?

Any help rendered would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Some observations I gathered while doing the Week 4 tasks:

1. Setup instructions for Gradle requires deleting `.idea` folder and reopening the project (or invalidating caches as suggested by [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5905896/intellij-inspection-gives-cannot-resolve-symbol-but-still-compiles-code))
1. Project opening time is noticeably longer after Gradle is integrated, with the pop-up mentioning something about indexing project files
1. JavaFX libraries are automatically installed upon [addition of dependencies](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html) into `build.gradle` and restart of IntelliJ IDE

My guess is IntelliJ somehow caches project information inside the `.idea` folder, which includes commands to load Gradle and its configuration files upon opening the project. Could someone perhaps point me to resources to find out more? 😃 

The fact that the IDE automatically does dependency checking and library installation without the user initiating these operations sounds a little intrusive 😢 Or maybe I'm too used to a simple text editor environment.

Same problem occurred to me as well, after specifying the JavaFX dependencies in `build.gradle`.

You could try this sequence of steps: closing the project, deleting the `.idea` folder (or alternatively selecting Invalidate Cache) and then reopening it again and let Gradle/IDE rebuild these files.

I'm assuming you're using IntelliJ here?

Jumping on the bandwagon :)

If dealing with images is too troublesome, can consider not using them at all. Went for a multi-monitor look-and-feel with an 'always-on' list, so that I can lower stress levels leaving `list` out between every command. The past commands are made clickable to make correcting wrong commands easier, by adding an `onMouseClicked` event to the individual boxes.

Handy tool, have been using Snipping Tool for a long time now 👍🏻 

Since we're on this topic, if you're willing to spend a small amount of time overriding the `PrintScreen` button, I highly recommend [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/) for Windows users to replace the default screen capture tool.

1. Gives you pixel-accurate screenshot abilities:

Hello, 

Basically, I'm trying to complete the testing stage of Tuturial 3 and I can't pass this last test case. 

I followed the instructions closely and am currently this issue:

Basically, it's testing that the same name with different attributes should still be considered the "same person". (Refer to last highlighted line (assertTrue....)

So what I tried to do is to go to Person.java's isSamePerson() and edit it as such:

Hello, 

So I followed the instructions of this week's IP closely and I am pretty sure I did not make any mistakes. 

However, after I was done with branch-A-Assertions and branch-A-CodeQuality, my Git tree looks quite messed up. 

Basically, it seems that branch-A-Assertions is branching out of my branch-A-CodeQuality which is not even possible because I did it stepwise. 

Can someone tell me if I messed up?

Hi all, 

I am currently trying to adhere to the Java coding standard by using checkstyle. However, after downloading it from the official checkstyle website (version 8.40), I am unsure of which checkstyle file to actually use in my .config/checkstyle, as seen from the screen shot below. 
Am I doing something wrong or are we supposed to use a provided checkstyle.xml file somewhere?

For instance, in one of the tutorials, we had a remark field that need not be present.
So let's compare the following:
```
Person (Name name, Phone phone, Address address, Remark remark) {
}
```
or

```
Person (Name name, Phone phone, Address address, Optional<remark> remark) {
}
```
My friends and I were discussing that if we were to consider a UML diagram, the multiplicity of remark should be 0 to 1.
However, if we do not specify a remark, the method would fill it in with an empty string "", but yet still creating a Remark object.
Also, we should not be passing in a NULL as it is generally a bad idea.

So the question remains, which is the better way to pass a remark into the person constructor?

The notion of writing good code is to write readable code, and both streams and loops can do the same job.
While some might be more familiar with the functional paradigm, others may be more comfortable with the standard loops.
Hence my question:
Are streams more or less readable than their for/while loop counterparts?

In other words, should I be writing more streams when I could? or rather avoid streams and stick to using loops?

Thanks, @SoonKeatNeo for your insights 👍 Although I am comfortable with using both, I do agree with what you mentioned that preference of one over the other is subjective.
I believe @rajobasu is somewhat right in the sense that it is about writing lesser code, and could lead to easier to manage code. Along with @Cheng20010201 who mentions that streams could be used for parallelizing and processing a large dataset.

I guess it really depends on the use then, perhaps the conventional for loops for simple functions, and streams when I know I have to handle a large amount of data.

But I was wondering from the industry standpoint, would software engineers tend to be more comfortable with loops or streams?  Is there some kind of industry preference out there if any of you guys have an internship experience.

I've been using some JavaFX Alerts in my code and the problem is that sometimes when I switch windows while the Alert is displayed, the Java application just suddenly crashes without me nor the Java application doing anything in the meantime.
It wouldn't crash if I stay on the application even with an indefinite amount of time. So I'm pretty confident it's not a coding issue, and I found out that it's supposedly it's a system issue on MacOS Mojave on window switching.

I think it may have to do with `System.lineSeparator()` as line separators differ from operating system to operating system. You should be able to toggle the lineSeparator in IntelliJ on the bottom tool bar from a label that says either LF/CR/CRLF. But it might be better to not use `System.lineSeparator()`.

From my understanding, the `finally` block is used for resource releasing. As in although Java has a garbage collector, there are still some classes/objects you'll have to manually close, such as files. So if you opened a file in a `try` block, you'll have close it in the `finally` block, because the `finally` block would execute regardless.

Some checkstyle files have syntax errors or version incompatibility, not sure which. But most of them are issues with `TreeWalker`. Edit the xml file and move the modules in the warnings out of `TreeWalker` one by one.

Like for this screenshot, you'll want to move the entire `FileContentsHolder` module out of `TreeWalker`.

Just move them warning by warning. I don't think there are that many of them.

Personally, I feel that if the chaining of stream methods are properly line skipped looks cleaner as compared to loops as loops increase indentation levels and as the indentation levels goes up, the code becomes more unreadable. So for me, I use streams to replace small loops in order to increase code readability.

Perhaps I am misunderstanding something, allow me to clarify my thought process:
As Jackson is a 3rd party dependency, there are 2 ways to manage it.

- we can add it to the classpath manually
- we can use a package manager to manage our dependencies

From my understanding, Gradle is meant for build automation, but Maven is meant to do dependency management (Perhaps I am wrong about this)

With that reasoning in mind, I asked if we should use Maven to manage Jackson, so that version updates etc can be quickly and easily taken care of by updating the pom.xml file. However, if Gradle can do this as well, then it would make more sense to use Gradle as the project is already intending to use it down the road.

Do let me know if this makes sense 😅

I agree the quote from you, and I think that is the main reason to use interfaces. As for "why not use abstract class?", I think the need for abstract class (on top of interface) is just for us to define some functions that are the same in its child class, so as to reduce repetition. Other than that, a class can implement multiple interfaces, which gives us more flexibility, while a class cannot extend multiple abstract classes.

What I can think of is something like the example in Week 8 Topics. If two class they are partners of each other, no one is superior than the other. In that case, both of them should maintain a reference to each other and thus have a bi-directional association. This is just my point of view, correct me if I'm wrong.

1. I think it's just for better abstraction purpose. 
2. I think the exclusion of ```getUserPrefsFilePath()``` from ```Storage``` interface is a mistake, as ```getAddressFilePath()``` is included in ```Storage``` interface. But anyways, ```StorageManager``` will still inherit that method from grandparent interface, so it's fine.

Even if we remove ```Storage``` interface completely, the code will still work fine, since ```Storage``` didn't add any new signatures. Hence, I think the existence of that is just to achieve better architecture design and abstraction:))

By the way, I also found AB3 diagram doesn't show the inheritance of ```Storage``` from ```UserPrefsStorage``` and ```AddressBookStorage```, so maybe they intended to let ```StorageManager``` to inherit directly from ```UserPrefsStorage``` and ```AddressBookStorage``` at first.

I've been trying to jar the project for quite a while but got stuck at this error.

While my project directory and the file path is like this

What I did with Storage class is

        this.file = new File(filepath);
        FileReader fr;
        try {
            file.createNewFile();
     ...

Can someone please help, what is wrong with my jar? 
I guess there is something wrong with my file path, but I could not figure out why. I followed the steps of creating java jar in the tutorial given in A-Jar segment.
Thx a lot in advance!

Hi all,
May I ask how the issue page is supposed to look like after a few commits and tags pushed to origin..
What I have done are:
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "level x"
3. git push
4. git tag "level x"
5. git push origin --tags
But inside the page https://github.com/myusename/ip/issues url, it shows 'Welcome to Issues!' without my previous taggings and all.
Is it supposed to look like this?

> From the file path and where you’re running the JAR from, I think the relative path there would imply that your duke.txt file is in: `...\Java\compileroutput\artifacts\ip_jar\src\data\duke.txt`, which I guess is not what you have set up? You can verify this if you create the src\data directory in ip_jar folder.

Hi thx!
I don't have a ip_jar\src folder at all, I just went to check the jar structure and it looks like this
ip.jar
->data
->->duke.txt
->main
->->java
->->->...all classes etc

btw, may i clarify what do you mean by create the src\data directory in ip_jar folder?

After I finished the tutorial for the remark command, I tried to ran the tests again but a lot of them failed and I'm not sure why, since I did not modify tests in other test classes except for RemarkCommandTest. In the picture below there's an error for the equals method in RemarkCommandTest, but looking at the code it doesn't make sense as both objects are the same. I tried to run the debugger and the error "Cannot find local variable 'addressBookFromFile'" comes up, but I can't seem to find which local variable it is referencing to in the RemarkCommandTest method. If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated!

For some reason, my Intellij doesn't seem to work, and gives me a ton of error, yet when I run the Gradle script, it seems to work fine. For example, when this is my start method in my Main class as per the JavaFX tutorial (exactly the same).

But once again, running Gradle's `verficiation/test` works and passes my testcase just fine.

Is this a cause for concern, because my code is literally the same and yet these error that are not present before are here suddenly.

Yes! my `mainClassName` is "Launcher", and I've been trying to run  using the Launcher `main()` method haha
What I'm confused is that the error says `Location is not set`, and yes when I tried  to `System.out.println(Main.class.getResource("/view/MainWindow.fxml"))` I get a `null`, and hence I'm really confused since Gradle should be using the same code (and the tutorial literally works before with the same code) and yet for some reason my IDE is popping up all these errors now haha

Good day,

I'm trying to do Level-10: GUI.
I have followed the [JavaFX tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFx.html) for both my actual [DukeBot](https://github.com/douglaswja/ip/tree/fix-unable-to-open-display) and a [dummy one](https://github.com/douglaswja/gui-dukebot-stub) that uses a DukeBot stub, as recommended by the [Week 4 Project page](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/schedule/week4/project.html#3-add-increments-as-branches-a-gradle-a-checkstyle-level-10-a-varargs).

In both of these projects, whenever I use the command `./gradlew run` I get the following error:
![unable-to-open-display-error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27340314/107868959-e2f02880-6ec3-11eb-810e-f630b9cd2861.png)

However, in the dummy project where a stub of DukeBot was setup to support the JavaFX classes given in the tutorial, running the Launcher via Intellij works fine. (Running my full DukeBot via Intellij gives an error which I suspect might be unrelated).

Notes:
1. I looked at the [forum post about getting Intellij to build and run using Gradle](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/97) and have confirmed that my Intellij settings are the same as in the post. So it surprises my that running via Intellij works whereas running via `./gradlew run` does not.
2. I have updated my build.gradle to set the main class as the Launcher.java.
3. I have pushed both projects to github repositories so that anyone whos interested can recreate the error:
- [Branch of Full iP](https://github.com/douglaswja/ip/tree/fix-unable-to-open-display)
- [Branch of Stub DukeBot](https://github.com/douglaswja/gui-dukebot-stub)

Hi, I'm trying to do A-Gradle and I keep encountering the following problem.

esktop/NUS Work/Y3S2/CS2103/ip/build/resources/main}.
```

If i run `./gradlew run` my iP works fine and can be interacted with, however `./gradlew build` always fails and gives the above error.
I have searched online forums and also tried debugging my build.gradle file by using println statements, everything seems to be working fine but the error keeps appearing.

I have also compared my build.gradle against a friends whose one works and it seems to match, only differing in our file names.

I am using WSL2 and IntelliJ.

Does anyone know how to fix the above issue?
By not being able to build the project via Gradle I cannot complete A-Gradle and every subsequent task that relies on Gradle.


Notes:
1. I got the checkstyle.xml and supressions.xml from the AB-3 Github page
2. The above xml files are in the correct directory (ip/config/checkstyle)
3. The following code in build.gradle correctly points to the directory mentioned in point 2. I checked using a println statement.
```
checkstyle {
    toolVersion = '8.29'
    configFile = rootProject.file("${rootDir}/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml")

Hi @tjtanjin, thanks for the quick response.

In line with your suggestions I have attempted the following:
1. I removed the line in gradle.build containing `configFile = ...` however the same error occured.
2. I've looked through the [guide you uploaded on the CS2103 forum](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/93) and I'm pretty sure my steps matched those in the guide when I was setting up Gradle.
3. I've pushed my current version to [a branch in my repo called fix-gradle-unable-to-create-root-module](https://github.com/douglaswja/ip/tree/fix-gradle-unable-to-create-root-module) for any kind person whos willing to take a look.

Hi prof @damithc, the issue is on our group's PR such as https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/166. Do understand that codecov reports are not used, but then its something nice for us to have since, it tells us how much coverage we would have increase with our test cases. So not sure if there is anything we can do to enable it back.

Hello there!

For my team's tP, we're implementing some feature that uses `mailto` links. These links would invoke the user's OS default mail client (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.) to send an email, which is technically using external software.  In case the user does not have a default mail client assigned, the user's web browser opens an empty new window.

However, neither does the application require a particular mail client to be installed in the OS, nor does it require the use of third-party Java libraries.

Is it okay to have the aforementioned behaviour in our application? More specifically, does it violate the **[`Constraint-External-Software`](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/admin/tp-constraints.html#constraint-external-software)** constraint?

Hello everyone!

Just wanted to highlight a possible typo while I was reading the CS2103/T online textbook.
In the _Polymorphism_ section of the _Supplementary: C++ to Java_ chapter, the ```Cat``` and ```Dog``` classes in the ```PetShelter``` example seem to miss the ```extends``` keyword.

While it is a small typo, the Java file will not compile due to the calls of the ```super``` constructor in both classes.

Thank you.

Oh right, it could be. But if that was the case, then the ```super``` calls in the constructors of ```Cat``` and ```Dog``` would raise a compile-time error when trying to compile these classes.

I've tried to follow the instruction and create a new module test from an existing source. But somehow I still having trouble importing duke. Duke. There is no dependencies tab for the test module and when I add reference of Duke in DukeTest, the hint has suggested moving duke. Duke into test/java/duke instead of creating dependencies. Did I miss out on some steps in the instructions or is there something wrong with my setup in the IntelliJ.

> You might want to try unmarking your `src` folder as `Sources Root` and then marking the `java` folder within your `main` folder as `Sources Root` first. Then, check if the directory structure in your `java` file in the `main` folder mirrors that of the `java` file inside your `test` folder. You shouldn't have to explicitly import `Duke` in your test class. Use `Duke` in the test class as you would normally in the main class and a prompt would pop up for you again to rectify the error. See if any of the above helps :D

Thanks @tlylt @kouyk @damithc for the insights! Here is a quick summary (or at least my understanding, feel free to correct me!) based on the advice above: it seems that if the type of the Exception changes due to the difference in level of abstraction, it would be best for the code at a higher level of abstraction to catch and transform the Exception to an appropriate one that matches the current level of exception. Whereas, if the level of abstraction is the same (or the type of exception is the same) the code does not need to catch the exception and the Exception will automatically be handled.
In addition, the stack trace will still be preserved when you
a. Transform the exception, or
b. let the method automatically handle the exception e.g
```
public void method() throws SomeException {
    handleBadOutcome(isBadOutcome);    // Note the lack of the try and catch block here.
    ...
}

private void handleBadOutcome(boolean isBadOutcome) throws SomeException {
    if (isBadOutcome) {
        throw new SomeException();
    }
}
```

for my storage class, it loads the data file from memory directly and then returned the taskList from the data and so I use ```taskList = storage.load();```. 

I think line 2, ```storage.load(taskList);``` works by first loading the dataList onto an arrayList, perhaps by using another class like parser, and then ```storage.load(taskList)``` loads the taskList into duke's tasklist. 

I think that the first way is more convenient, but both ways are valid and your implementation depends on your definition of storage, i.e is storage suppose to load the data from memory into duke or is storage loading the data already in duke to its tasklist.

I think that 
'Class A {
   void doStuff(B b) {
       b.doCStuff();
  }
}
Class B {
   C c;
   void doCStuff() {
      getC().doCStuff();
  }
}' 
really is worth the effort in refactoring, because it can really help cut down on possible bugs and mistakes that are likely to arise when you add more code to class A's doStuff() method. Also, having getters that gets class C can make any changes to class C or B especially tedious in the long run, which strengthens the case for refactoring. 

I think that it might not always be applicable to do
'Class A {
   void doStuff(C c) {
       c.doCStuff();
  }
}'
For instance, A can be personListManager and B can be a person and C can be the person's name. It does not really make sense for A to directly call c.doCStuff, as it may only be managing B (that contains C), and can also become an unnecessary association that can make the code overly complicated in the long run.

Hello, I am currently trying to follow the Tutorial: Removing Fields found here: https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp/tutorials/RemovingFields.html, but I am having difficult understanding the instructions, namely the line underlined below.

What does it mean to be performing `Safe Delete`s on each entry? 

For instance, in the case in the screenshot, should I be trying to safe delete the parseAddress(String) method (shown below)

 Because this raises even more safe delete conflicts, and I'm not sure what to do about them

A workaround (while you are waiting for a reply/figuring out the solution) can be:
instead of using
`private Image user = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/DaUser.png"));`
you can use
`private Image user = new Image("file:./pathToFileFromRootDirectory/DaUser.png")`
you may need to handle cross platform `/` or `\` though if you do this.

From what I see from reading the [Checkstyle documentation](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_naming.html), it doesn't look like its very possible unless you write? your own module for checkstyle. I don't think there's a module in checkstyle that applies specifically only to final variables.

I suppose you could include a Regexp module to check for final variables, but it does seem quite overkill. Also, not sure how overlapping modules work.

Anyway, I believe this is a case of where a discrepancy exists between coding standards and the given `checkstyle.xml`, since as you pointed out, you will violate both `AbbreviationAsWordInName` and `MemberName` if you rename the final (nonstatic) variable to SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. From what prof mentioned in [the issue you raised previously on final variables](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/98#issuecomment-771352035), I believe we will not be faulted if we do not use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for final (nonstatic) variables.

Hi, can you try typing `where java` in your terminal. It shows the location of your current java installations in your computer. If you see more than 1 location, it might be that you are using one of your older version (java 8) to run your runtest.bat file.

I believe that your current Java path in your environment variable is pointing to Java 8. Can you replace that path with your java 11 path (you can use the directory given in the `where java` command) and try to run your runtest.bat file again?

I used enums for the commands and a switch statement in the main method. For the enum class, I used a [constructor for the enum constants](https://dzone.com/articles/usage-enumeration-enum-java#:~:text=We%20use%20Enum%20for%20a,final%20keywords%20to%20represent%20constants.&text=We%20can%20define%20values%20for,field%20variable%20for%20this%20enum.) to give them a String value. This is so that I can relate the enum commands to the commands inputted by the user.
e.g. `TODO("todo")`
However since the commands in my main were of String type, I converted them to the enum type using a [lookup method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1080904/how-can-i-lookup-a-java-enum-from-its-string-value) and only after that pass the commands into a switch statement.

@chesterhow I agree, it does seem quite verbose to have additional manipulation to support the enum type. But I think some possible benefits enum could have over stacking `static final` constants in main is that it provides better readability, and added functionality (enum methods).

Hi, 

Can anyone tell me how to fix this error? It pops out when I am trying to save the program to the hard disk on the second run. Writing to the file works well as shown in the first screenshot below.

I'm not sure actually. My project team helped me to test out my duke.jar file and seems like it works well in Mac and Linux.
However, the error sometimes happens on windows. I tried to run it as administrator, but it doesn't help 🙁.

If this is the case? Should I just release my jar file?

Thanks for your reply.

Faced this problem, realised that gradle refuses to use the java version specified in the project settings. 

As what Gokul has mentioned, you can also check if your java version is actually defaulted to 11 in terminal.
`java -version`

I solved by doing the following:
1) Removed all java jdks on mac
`sudo rm -rf /Library/Java/*`

2) Remove all java jdks in this folder
Library>Java>JavaVirtualMachines

3) Reinstall jdk11 from oracle

4) Rebuild gradle and create jar file 

Hope this helps anyone facing the same issue!

Hello, I noticed that ref frames [as shown in the textbook](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/schedule/week6/topics.html#tools-uml-sequence-diagrams-reference-frames) have their captions placed beside the `ref` label in the top-left, rather than below the label.

However, I have searched the PlantUML [language reference](http://plantuml.com/guide) and [searched around](https://forum.plantuml.net/6867/sequence-diagram-sub-diagrams) but cannot find out how to position the caption next to the `ref` label.

Hi, it seems to me that the Ui might be appropriate as an interface which can then be implemented now with a TextUI and later as a GUI. I am opening this thread for two reasons:

1. to ask the teaching team if it is acceptable to define Ui as an interface instead of a class
2. to get other opinions on this subject

I considered a (possibly abstract) base class but it seems like a GUI and a text UI (TUI) might use fundamentally different mechanisms (and hence different member variables) to display stuff hence they largely only have method signatures in common. At this point, using an interface seems more appropriate than a base class. Any thoughts?

What constitutes the domain on inputs when considering equivalence partitions (EPs)?

For example, lets take the following function as an example

```
def String echo(String s) { return s; }
```

Then there are probably only a few partitioning for strings of different lengths, maybe made up of different characters/encodings, etc. 

But what about things that are not strings? Do those form their on EPs? For instance, this function should throw an exception if we pass in doubles, integers, arrays, etc. Do those also count as EPs?

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Best practice for unit testing of classes**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/43" expanded>

In topic W3.6c about unit testing, the following skeleton is provided.

```
class FooTest {
    
    @Test
    void read() {
        // a unit test for Foo#read() method
    }
    
    @Test
    void write_emptyInput_exceptionThrown() {
        // a unit tests for Foo#write(String) method
    }  
    
    @Test
    void write_normalInput_writtenCorrectly() {
        // another unit tests for Foo#write(String) method
    }
}
```

In the case where there isn't much set-up required for initializing `Foo` objects, it is trivial to instantiate a new object in each test method. However, if there is a lot of set-up involved (ie population of multiple attributes of `Foo` via setter methods before the object is in a minimal state for testing), then it would be tedious to repeat the process in every method.

What would be the best practice in such a scenario? Would it be appropriate to create a method within `FooTest` that returns this properly instantiated `Foo` object or are there other best practice/conventions?

Hi guys,

I would like to check for the branches that we have in our local repository, are we allowed, or is it a good practice to delete those once the PRs are being approved by our teammates? From what I could foresee in the near future, there could be many overlapping branches that could contain outdated branches (for instance branch-Ui-Update, branch-Ui-Update1, branch-Ui1-Update) in our local repo as we further improve upon our codes and this format could vary from individuals.

Hi guys,
I am not sure if I am doing the right way of running javac *.java and commiting all the .class file. I do not commit everytime I compile, only the time when I finalized with doing a task. From what I see now, it looks quite okay, but if say, we are going to implement more classes in the future, there would be too many stuffs within a certain directory. Is this considered as a 'right' way or a bad practice? What are your thoughts on this?

To add on, when you run the Duke.java (or your Main java file) in Intellij, the .class files are generated and stored in the bin directory. This directory is not committed because it's excluded in the .gitignore file. So you could consider adding `/src/main/java/*.class` to your .gitignore file to exclude the .class files.

Hi, I think that in your `build.gradle` file the `mainClassName` should be "Launcher" instead of "Duke". Try changing this and regenerating the `.jar` file.

Hi, I tried cloning your repo and running it locally (also windows) and it's working fine for me. This could mean that your system is blocking access to  `duke.txt` after the first run for some reason.&gt;br>

I would like to clarify when the instance name can be omitted in object diagrams. In the textbook, it states that if the instance name is omitted, the object instance can be interpreted as an unnamed instance. In this question, however, the Member instances are all named, yet their instance names were omitted.

Does this mean that in UML object diagrams, the instance names are always optional, regardless of whether the instance is named or unnamed?

Any idea why this happens?
Does this mean there's something wrong with the IntelliJ terminal?


I am running respond("hi\n" + "bye\n").
```java
public static void respond(String response) {
        System.out.print(Arrays.stream(response.split(System.lineSeparator())).map(line -&gt; "head: " + line).collect(Collectors.joining("\n")));
    }

I'm trying to format my responses, with this method respond(String response),
which is intended to help edit any string to the format I want, so it looks better.

> From my understanding, the `finally` block is used for resource releasing. As in although Java has a garbage collector, there are still some classes/objects you'll have to manually close, such as files. So if you opened a file in a `try` block, you'll have close it in the `finally` block, because the `finally` block would execute regardless.

Thank you for your response, I am learning new things, like about garbage collecting I had no idea was related.

But if Im not failing to get something, I still think my question remains: 
is 'finally' block any different from putting its codes outside the try-catch block?
i.e. why can't we just close the file outside the entire 'try-catch' block
And to which, I think I have some idea now.

Did anyone encounter InvocationTargetException and NullPointerException during the integration of JavaFX into the project?

Apparently, the error happens when I entered something like "todo book" into the textbox. I suspect it is due to the first spacing of the string. When I enter "todobook" or "todobook and", the response can be returned from the DialogBox. I made a duplicate copy of the project without JavaFx and everything is working fine.

I've already 1) imported the libs folder from the SDK into the project, 2) added the necessary paths to the VM options in Run > Edit Configurations and 3) edited the build.gradle with the necessary dependencies. I believe that is everything that we were told to do [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html)?

Any idea why there are still errors?

I second what @w2vgd has said. `break` allows your program to break out of the switch block, while `return` allows your program to break out of the method call. Choosing one of them will do!

In the DialogBox.fxml file, we can set the size of the Label element (found under Layout on the right pane) to the settings as follows. I believe this is similar to what @swayongshen has mentioned, by not fixing the height/width.

From my perspective, this increment means we should make our code as OOP as possible. Thus I think it would be a good practice to try to refactor your code to make it fits the OOP principle more. Although during this process, you may found that FP is useful for some parts of your code and you applied FP, OOP is still the bigger idea and you can just tag it `A-MoreOOP` after you are done refactoring your code. Hope this helps.

**Solution**:
There are a couple of solutions to this I have found:

1. Use a font that works in for all OS (There are a couple obvious ones such as Arial, Times New Roman, alternatively can google supported fonts for major OSes).

I thought of using enums for the commands too, but as @JonahhGohh mentioned, the commands were of String type and some additional manipulation was required before using them in a switch statement. This seems to be more verbose and tedious as compared to simply using `static final` constants.

I can't help but wonder if there's any benefit to using enums in this scenario instead of constants. Any thoughts? 🤔

I have merged `branch-Level-8` after `branch-Level-7` into the master. However, some of my `Level-8` changes result in `Level-7` changes to fail.

So I am making a feature that will be making use of the list of tags and decided to follow this design. The issue comes when I want to check whether the tag is already created and then retrieve it from the list. I think Tag should not need to know about the UniqueTagList.

With reference to how a Person is created, its uniqueness is only checked at AddCommand via a call to model.hasPerson. But at this point, Tags are already created by ParserUtil, which also does not need to know about the UniqueTagList, because the Model is outside its range of knowledge I think. So I don't really know where I should be checking for and retrieving Tags from the UniqueTagList, when Tags are created in the Parser section and only the command classes will know about the Person and model at the same time. Maybe check it at the AddCommand too, and then replace the entire Person object? Seems inefficient? Please advice on the design..

A new Person is created at AddCommandParser and checked for its uniqueness at AddCommand, and then discarded when found to be duplicate. So I guess I can create the set of Tags and then check and add it into Person in the AddCommand..

I am unable to see the main comment because I did not submit one before submitting the review, so I think I am unable to add the top/main comment. Thanks for the help though, I will try to add an extra trailing comment at the end 😄.

Nothing fancy here but a suggestion for anyone still struggling: try using ".png" files instead of ".jpg" files as images. 

It was the major problem I faced when class.getResourceAsStream() kept throwing null pointer exception saying the input stream was null when I used ".jpg" images even though it could read the ".fxml" files just fine...

you can also checkout issue #101 to ensure full printing of longer messages, thanks to @tjtanjin for that!!

Hi, I have encountered similar issues before, and I resolved it by adding the following lines:

`-name: Make gradlew executable`

` run: chmod +x ./gradlew`

in my gradle.yml. Maybe you want to try it out?

Edit: to clarify, you will need to place it before the lines
`- name: Build and check with Gradle`

` run: ./gradlew check`
so that the changes to the permission will take effect before gradlew runs

I am facing this issue whereby the fx:controller of AnchorPane in MainWindow.fxml is unable to detect the controller class that is in the Controllers package as seen in the picture above. When I hover over the error, it says class/package cannot be resolved.

Am I navigating the package/file wrongly? Is there a specific way to use a controller?

Thank you!

Initially, I thought of using enums for easy iteration as well, but it still presents the problem of poor readability ( I really don't like the long switch/if-else statements presented as we added more and more keywords ). I opted for using a HashMap instead and eventually led to using the [Command Pattern](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/designPatterns.html#command-pattern) presented in the book.

Thanks for the suggestion! However, personally, using HBox did not work for me 

I managed to get things working by adding `dialog.setMinHeight(Region.USE_PREF_SIZE)` in the constructor of DialogBox, as per the second answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35012518/resize-javafx-label-if-overrun

Hi everyone! We are currently working on creating issues for our tp, and are wondering if we need to do anything with milestone v1.1. 

From what we understand, milestone v1.2 is the MVP, so our user stories should be tagged with that. In that case the already created v1.1 milestone tag will be left empty. Is there anything that we need to do with that milestone? Do we need to close or edit it?

When using the scene builder, the FXML is generated.
The FXML generated will violate the following coding standard
-  Imported classes should always be listed explicitly. (Generated FXML sometime use *) 
-  Line length should be no longer than 120 chars. (Generated FXML does not  wrap)

Do we need to manually fix the FXML every time the scene builder generates the FXML to meet the java coding standard?

Suppose I'm trying to modify elements of the GUI and hence requires access to some property in UIManager. The current state of AB3 doesn't seem to be able to allow access to said property from a `Model` object, which is modified when a `Command` is executed. One way I was able to circumvent this issue is to use a third class to store a reference to the property I need and then accessing it from that third class whenever I need it.

The introduction of this third class seem to be introducing cyclic dependencies into this program. Assuming I can properly test this new feature, document it, and ensure it does not affect any other features being added, will I still be marked down for this?

Hi, "Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They're kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub's tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository."
Since no one reported a bug or found any issues in your code so it is totally fine that is empty.
