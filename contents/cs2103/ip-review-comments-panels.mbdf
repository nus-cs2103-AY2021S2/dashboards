I am not sure if this is a code quality issue, however, I would recommend using `this.task` rather than using `this.getTask()`. This is because `this.getTask()` does the same thing as `this.task`.

Perhaps if your `getTask` method does extra processing for the String that is returned back then it would be justifiable?

From the textbook -&gt; Be wary when a method is longer than the computer screen, and take corrective action when it goes beyond 30 LOC (lines of code). The bigger the haystack, the harder it is to find a needle.

2. There should be "Punctuation behind each parameter description". I.e. Lines 12 and 13 of Deadline.java should end with a period, as shown below.

alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression) ? beta : gamma;
alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression)
        ? beta
        : gamma;

From the CS2103 Java Coding Standard:

From the CS2103 Java coding standard, Javadoc should have "Punctuation behind each parameter description -No blank line between the documentation block and the method/class".

I'm unsure if this applies to the first sentence and return type but in other classes of this PR (e.g. Parser.java) the first sentence and return type of the Javadoc both end with a period.

Consistency of punctuation in Javadocs across the various classes might be a way to improve this PR.

Though you probably already satisfy the "Javadoc more than 50% of public classes and methods" requirements, a useful tip is that by adding Javadocs to a class with methods to be overriden such as the abstract Command class, these Javadocs will appear in Quick Tip windows when users however over overriden implementations.

E.g. Writing a javadoc for getResponse in the Command class will show users the Javadoc when they activate Quick Tip (Ctrl + Q in IntelliJ) for an overriden method in the DeleteTaskCommand class even though there isnt a Javadoc written in the DeleteTaskCommand class.

It might be best to capitalise the names of constants even if they are private attributes.

Unless the application is behaving incorrectly with the final keyword, I am inclined to think that capitalizing the instance attributes would be the better option. The final keyword reliably ensures that the state of the attribute is never modified and this seems especially important for the taskList, which should not have a new list object unintentionally overwriting it. I have to admit I am not too experienced with java and have only read up on the use of final recently so I am open to and would appreciate any advice on this as well :D

Should the logic used extract out the description be simplified to make it more understandable? Perhaps instead of splitting on spaces and combing all the words after todo, you can simply remove the word 'todo' from the String? This will make require only a single line of code and is much more compact.

Something like:

```
String description  = line.replace("todo", "").strip()  //.strip() is to remove trailing spaces
```

The same can be applied in other parts of your code for descriptions of deadlines and events.

Should you leverage the LocalDate or some other library to convert the date and time format? I feel that doing so will make the code less cluttered and save you the trouble of writing everything from scratch. This can also be applied to all the classes which inherit from Task.

This exact code which parses a String to Date object can be seen multiple times throughout your code. 

Perhaps would it be better if the method is abstracted into another class (eg. `DateParser`) and made into a static method? 

This way, you can still access the same code from your other classes and at the same time, improve the maintainability of your code as you would only be required to edit it once if it is abstracted into a separate method and class.

### Should `storage` and `ui` be in uppercase?

Honestly, I wouldn't consider this to be violations, but I'll leave it to you to judge: 
    - Your variables are final whenever possible, which is good, 
    - However, that means it probably should be written in uppercase according to the coding convention. 
    - My personal belief is that only static final variables should be written in uppercase, but the coding convention isn't clear on that. 
    - However, an example they provided was `final int COLOR_RED = 1;` which leans towards the former,

Here instead of breaking after the operator you could break before it. For example, instead of:

Not sure I like the length of this method. Maybe abstraction could be applied here. For instance, the general format seems to be 

if command matches some format, then parse the parameters, then execute the command, then return feedback

I feel that there are four responsibilities here: 
1. matching the command
2. parsing the arguments
3. executing the command
4. building the feedback message

The name "at" doesn't seem very comprehensive and I wouldn't be able to tell what it is used for unless I know what an Event object is meant for and how to create one from the CLI.

For all of your JavaDocs, 
1. There should be punctuations at the end of every sentence in your description and every parameter definition. (Note that the descriptions are not supposed to be too long unless it is completely necessary)
2. There should be an empty line separating the description and parameter fields.
3. All sentences should have proper capitalisation.
4. JavaDocs of a method should be directly above a method, without a line separating them.

Hi, just a small inconsistency that I spotted. For some of your classes, there is an empty line between the class declaration and the class properties. However, some of the classes don't.

Overall, the `process` method seems to be longer than desired. Quoting our textbook:
> Be wary when a method is longer than the computer screen, and take corrective action when it goes beyond 30 LOC (lines of code). The bigger the haystack, the harder it is to find a needle.

Perhaps extract out some smaller methods?
