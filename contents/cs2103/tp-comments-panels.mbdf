This might sound like a bit of nitpicking, but then if I don't other teams might, the "adds" in this sentence can be confusing, perhaps we can use something like append/include/insert? Same for the things below.

I think this is the same issue as what you have raised about separation of the add/delete of dog/owner, in this case shall we just keep things simple and simply call it "missing required information"? To maintain clarify we can put a note at the bottom saying what field are required for dogs and owners. Doing it this way reduces clutter since we can combine more things together, makes any future edits less likely to miss out any detail.

isn't it just `otherOwner.getID() == getID()`? and I think we can do away with this check since it is reasonable enough that 2 owners with all details that are the same point to the same person, and some tests also uses this method to compare between owners.

This is not a bug, if you look carefully at the condition that triggers the exception, it is either when some compulsory arguments are missing or that there is some additional things in between the command keywords and the arguments. In this case, saying the unknown argument might be applicable, but only for the latter scenario. The more useful thing choice is to display help for the particular command or even subcommand like `add owner` will display the specifics are adding an owner.

I like that you have added in the javadocs, however, this is to be kept private as it is an internal helper method that should not be exposed to any other users. Perhaps you made it public in order to write test code for it, but I think it is better to refrain from that since it is the public API that we are testing out, the test code should not care about the actual implementation so long as it does what it promises. Else we will fall into this never ending issue of making all methods of every class public. I could have inlined these two lines into the switch case of the main `parse` method, but for SLAP I created the helper functions.

As commented above, this testing should not happen anymore, but should instead be tested through the `parse` method. Also, try to make use of the constants already defined to come up with the command instead of the magic literals.

Yes, you can take a look at the rest of the code base and see how it is done for the others. Especially for helper methods that are more concerned with internal implementation, they could be very dynamic and change every time.

Yup, the idea here is to take in the ID and verify with the backend that the owner does exist for this ID to be considered valid. But you can just put some placeholder functions now when it comes to the adding part.

Tbh I'm quite keen to remove the use of INDEX_*_*, because we have switched to referencing by ID and not by the visible index number. For this method it is fine of course, but there is a need to probably remove Index and create an ID class in its place, but that's probably another issue to be created.

As in because previously there was only one CommandTest so given ModelStub's nature it made sense to just have it as a private class of the Command, but going forward we probably want to abstract out a bit of these test code as well. The ModelStub should become a package private shared by all the CommandTests, it will be good to combine the tests under AddCommandTest.

okay I think i get the rationale for the returning the internalList directly, but it is alright to use the unmodifiable version as many other tests does the same. Also I think if this is targeted at owners but will not test dogs, it is a good idea to filter using instanceof as well.

Okay I understand this portion now, it might seem fine to do this for now, but the issue is that this codebase isn't very small, having equivalent api will confuse others that are not so familiar with this portion, and any direct modification is now possible since Java passes by reference, it will be difficult to track down bugs if someone modifies it and violates the assumptions we have about unique entities etc.

is it better to use the `hasEntity` method to check if the ID exists and throw an exception if it doesn't. then we can assume that `getFilteredEntityList` will return something that definitely contains the owner, then we retrieve it for real this time and check if it is indeed an owner object instead of any other entities. It will be better to use the `setEntity` method to change the target owner by creating a new copy with the up to date details.

as mentioned in the AddDogCommand portion, it will not necessary to directly modify the Entity objects since all attributes are constant throughout the lifetime of the object. This is to align to the original AB3 codebase whereby the edit command also modifies by creating an updated instance of `Person` before asking the model to set it as the new one.

Will it be better if we keep naming a little more consistent here?

Refrain from commenting like that, a better practice when using git is to simply delete all these lines that you don't need or want to disable, commit this set of changes as an individual commit. If you intend to fix it later, maybe leave a todo around the original area. This way even if we don't implement it there won't be a need to clean up the code much. But if you do intend to restore this portion, it will be simply a matter of finding the commit that removed the lines and reverting it, creating an additional commit that essentially negates the removal yet retaining full history.

This is not something that is meant for an assertion, since it is one of the expected possible errors that we need to handle.

I know this is a copy and paste from the tests for owner, but please drop the unfiltered part, if you wish you can drop them from the owner side as well. You probably don't understand the original behaviour of AB3, but it originally referenced to every entry by their index in the displayed list, thus filtering makes a difference to whether or not one can reference to a particular Person. We have since switched to using ID and whether or not the target entity to be edited is visible or not no longer matters. If you haven't noticed, there is no longer a filteredlist complement test as I've deleted them, but to prevent too many changes in one PR I refrained from doing the small renames.

How about doing this test for the `EditEntityDescriptor` instead? While testing here may or may not be redundant, it helps more to test the base class as well in case the bug actually lies inside there and the child classes are just a distraction from the real problem.

For typical dogs, I have inserted an owner so as to make all dogs have a valid owner. And that the ID of the owner is 1, therefore all dog IDs are offset by 1. The fix here should not be with the dog ID, but rather it should be the input text. You might feel that both are equivalent, but fixing it like the current way is convoluted and nobody can understand why the input is 1 yet the ID of the first dog does not match.

it will be good to test against `EditCommandParser` as well. I know it is an abstract class, but it is possible to create a simple implementation and test against that, especially for things like tags which there is a protected method that handles it for all classes. That way things like preamble etc only need to be tested once and not repeated since having repeated test cases on the same thing does not help with code coverage or prevent bugs but only increase the execution time of tests.

It will be good to adhere to the DRY principle and apply some OOP like in the main codebase. That way setName and setTags can all be simplified. It helps that EditEntityDescriptor is already in place so there isn't as much tweaking to do. This was also one of the reason I rewrote the Edit command implementation to ensure minimal repetition, avoiding potential points of failure when copying blindly and not keeping necessary parts updated.

originally this file worked together with only one typical addressbook, but now there is 3 copies on top of the fact that there is no longer ID, I think it will be better to define these constants directly within each addressbook to avoid confusion. Each of those addressbooks require better naming as well as they are not descriptive at all and there is nothing typical about them. To make it more typical, perhaps it is good to just combine 3 of those into a `TypicalEntities` class instead. Something like `getOwnersOnlyAddressBook` and `getSingleOwnerMultipleDogsAddressBook` will help make things clear.

As in I think that even this format it will be good to specify what each one of them means, like mm refers to minutes should be 00-59 etc, to prevent some lunatics from going crazy. Also this portion is kind of general, you might want to explicitly mention that the birth date of the dogs follows a similar format, omitting the time portion and that the date has to be on or before the current date.

I would say avoid defining dog IDs this way, especially since none of the others entities have defined their IDs this way. ID is largely dynamic and only because of the typical database being largely static that's why it was hardcoded. For tests that require the dogs IDs to be present but not necessarily correct, I suggest using the TypicalId class and use some of the numbers inside.

I don't want to do any finger-pointing here, while this is my oversight the previous time, it would be helpful if you broke down your commits such that every commit has a purposeful message along with the stated changes, that way it is easier for me look through at each step and figure out if anything is wrong. However, all that I get here is around 1k lines of code changed, barring the fact that the previous commit history didn't carry over, it is really difficult to be that careful. I won't request that you review what I changed for you in the previous PR, in short your builder pattern was less than ideal, thus sub-type information was lost, hence requiring the casting. I fixed it to avoid those issues, but since extra casting is not technically wrong but just poor coding practice, there wasn't anything that alerted or reminded me that these portions needed to be updated to remove the casting. The fix here is simple, just remove the cast. Do let me know if you don't understand any part.

It is not just whether or not someone is going to review it, git commits are supposed to be incremental regardless, the previous PR could have been kept by merging in the latest master and resolving the conflicts. By creating another PR the commit history and authorship are all gone, that's the same reason I previously tried to restrain myself from directly pushing to existing PRs and make everyone perform the minor changes themselves, it actually takes more effort to type all the comments I have given than to directly modify them myself.

I'm referring to more test cases that can be written, this line is the most logical thing I can point to. For tags and sessions, repeated values are all captured, but the tests clearly don't look out for this, in this current test case there is only repeated tags, which will be parsed as one.

the method name implies that multiple fields that should only be specified once are now specified multiple times, in which only the last repetition is to be accepted as the final value, programs clearly don't have such a field when being edited, both tags and sessions accepts all of the fields and will only ignore repeated values, what I need from you is to write test methods that instead test if multiple tags & sessions are all accepted.

Also, in the copy-paste process, you might have not spent the time to understand what each of the test are doing, there is an `expectedModel` which we modify by hand in the most crude way to keep things simple and avoid errors, while the `model` is the target that we let the `EditDogCommand` execute on and therefore modify.

Just in case you don't understand how Pawbook works, I will explain it here in the interest of everyone's time. Every dog has an owner, and so long as the dog exists, the owner must also exist, but not the other way around, so owners can be dogless and still exist. While we don't allow for dogs to be created without a valid owner, it is possible to change the ownership afterwards. If the edit requests for dog with ID 2 to be owned by owner with ID 3, obviously the original owner with ID 1 now needs to disown the dog, followed by owner with ID 3 taking over the dog instead. In case you're still confused, 3 entities have been edited at this point, 2 owners 1 dog.

You might want to install the checkstyle plugin on intellij and run it locally before committing. Another way is to run them using the command line via gradle like what the course material mentioned, which I will not repeat here.  There are two advantages to this, firstly you get feedback faster, since it is much quicker to run locally than for the CI to return its results, next several of us are watching this repo, each pull request and separate commits pushed to a PR will generate notifications/email for everyone subscribed, reducing unnecessary notifications will be helpful for everyone.

Another thing I've noticed is that intellij files are seeping in, i.e. `src/.idea`, by right `.gitignore` is configured to not add these files, you might want to check your setup to ensure that the excluded files are indeed excluded, else your future PR might still have the same issues.

If you look at the commits you're trying to merge, there's 5, only the last 2 are really relevant. The merge commits when you merge master into this branch can very easily clutter up the commit history, making it hard to find bugs later on. If you do not want to rebase, try to avoid merging unless you need to resolve conflicts. Otherwise, a rebase is a good idea to keep the git history linear. I will elaborate on the problematic code in the review.

I think some of my feedback for the previous attempt at writing test still stands, like the typical addressbook ideally should be combined as one since there's no benefit to having 3 that's hard to maintain, I do see some effort made to refactor some tests, but some generics are not written correctly. Furthermore, I think while most of the edit implementation can be attributed to you, kindly exclude the edit program ones as you initially only implemented edit owner and edit dog partially.

I feel that this doesn't need fixing, since we support arbitrary length phone numbers it is a feature rather than a bug.

Able to reproduce this, the issue is that delete command retrieves the entity manually from the filtered list, which is a mistake. The solution here could be to use the unfiltered list instead, however, there are already ways to retrieve an entity directly using its ID, that method should be used instead, similar to how edit is done.

I think this is common sense, and that I think it is safe to say that no one will recognise 99:96 as a valid format for the time of the day, it is more likely to be the score of a basketball match.

This is invalid because a program timing could be added retroactively, and even without that assumption, enforcing such constraints is not feasible since the actual json file can be edited and there is no way to determine if the rule holds when restoring.

I don't know what you meant by rebase either, it is too vague. There are 2 types of rebase, one that changes the root commit of the branch, i.e. the point whereby the branch branched off, and another is interactive rebase, where you can change the history of the commits through a variety of options like rearranging them, squashing them aka combining, or dropping some commits, which is what you want to do. What you have done seemed like neither of them, since both will rewrite the commit history and require a force push which evidently isn't present here. From what I can tell, it seems like is you have cherry-picked an irrelevant commit from @ZhangAnli that's already in the master branch into your current branch. Give it a shot to find out how to correct your git history, what you need here is an interactive rebase, in which case you can also take the time to edit the commit that you deleted `docs/images/EditCommandScreenshot2.png` and undo the deletion such that there is no longer a merge conflict. While I can perform these operations for you, I don't want to take away the learning opportunity from you by directly modifying your branch.

I like the colour change, but it doesn't seem like the issue has been resolved. I think what users expect is that the suggestions isn't selected unless arrow keys or tab is used to trigger the selection, then without those keypresses, the enter key will work for the command box directly, so commands like `list` and `exit` only need to press once without dismissing the suggestions.

If you want to work on the program right, I suggest following the Owner and Dog closely, even the examples should be similar, so there's "Program A", "Program B" etc, some will be manually added into the database while some are part of the typical database, if you notice the way that the OwnerTest and DogTest are written, most of the comparisons are actually between one that is within the typical list while another is from the manually added ones, preferably the new tests also follows the same to keep things consistent. The typical database will come in really handy when writing the delete tests, since some parts of the test will spillover into the delete dog portion to ensure that the dog ids are no longer within the enrolled programs.

I forgot another issue I want to bring up, while writing test case will let us discover bugs, it doesn't always mean that something that doesn't work with your test case is wrong, it might be that your test case is written wrongly in the first place, before modifying the functional code, please double check or even do some manual testing to see if the bug can be replicated to confirm that the behaviour is wrong...

Made those changes! Just that after restoring the execute() there's one test case failing in editDogCommandTest which I have commented out. I need your help for that, I have tested the database.equals(other.database) in equals() of ModelManager is failing. I tried printing it, the database is exactly the same object but it fails...

Yes, we should still do it. I added some comments to the test files. Essentially, when we create the test objects, we parse the `dateStr` to a `LocalDate` using the util methods. i.e. `withBirthday(...)` takes in a `dateStr`, parses that string and returns a new `Birthday` with a `LocalDate` in it.

Quite hard to abstract this method because of circular dependencies. I am using `this.toString()` in this method. 

Lets say if I create something like this to abstract:
```java
/**
 * This factory allows the creation of IllegalValueExceptions with inbuilt logging. We assume that everytime
 * a class uses this factory to create an exception, that exception will be thrown and so we log. This factory
 * should only be used for throwing IllegalValueExceptions for errors found during json deserialization.
 */
public class JsonExceptionFactory {
    private final Logger logger;
    private final String clazzName;
    private final Object object;

    public <T> JsonExceptionFactory(Class<T> clazz, String clazzToDeserialize, Object objectToDump) {
        logger = LogsCenter.getLogger(clazz);
        clazzName = clazzToDeserialize;
        object = objectToDump;
    }

    public IllegalValueException build(String message) {
        logger.warning(String.format(MESSAGE_DESERIALIZE_ERROR_DUMP_DATA, clazzName));
        logger.warning(object.toString());
        return new IllegalValueException(message);
    }
}
```

In `JsonAdaptedPerson.java`:
```java
// ...
private final JsonExceptionFactory exceptionFactory = new
            JsonExceptionFactory(JsonAdaptedPerson.class, "Person", this);
// ...
throw exceptionFactory.build(String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT,
                    Name.class.getSimpleName()));
```

Will have circular dependency because `JsonAdaptedPerson` owns `JsonExceptionFactory` owns `JsonAdaptedPerson`, to put it simply `JsonAdaptedPerson` -&gt; `JsonExceptionFactory` -&gt; `JsonAdaptedPerson`

We may want to break this up into at least 5 separate issues since each member is expected to update the DG. That way, each member can close the relevant issue when they are done with their part.

Further, I suggest we break up DG update issues by feature, rather than by team member because a DG update per feature seems like a more correctly-sized unit of work than a DG update per team member or one monolithic update consisting of everyone's updates.

> I would like to discuss if the command history should also include failed commands. I think there is merit to mimic the same behaviour where the invalid command can be access via up and down arrow keys so that a Power User can edit the invalid command rather than retype it all.

Hmm, thanks for the suggestion. SunRez currently does not consume the user's input when a command is invalid, so a power user can already edit an invalid command easily.

Would it be better if the `.next()` method is never called for `Completion`? But I do understand that it has to implement the method in this scenario. So I guess its fine.

Didn't realize that the update command is called as such `update 1 proceed/`, without anything behind the prefixes. So they are not really prefixes in this case, so maybe the forward slashes are not intuitive for the user and should be removed. Sorry!!

An alternative suggestion may be to change the command format to `update INDEX s/STATUS`? 
E.g. `update 1 s/NEW`, `update 1 s/proceed`, `update 1 s/cancel`
In this case, you can even make use of the `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultiMap` classes to parse the inputs.
Will this be better?

`withAppointment` takes in an actual `Appointment` object. So if an example is given, it will be quite verbose.
E.g. `AppointmentBook ab = new AppointmentBookBuilder().withAppointment(new Appointment(new Name("Meet Alex"), new Remark("remark"), new Date(LocalDate.parse("2021-01-01")), new Time(LocalTime.parse("20:00:00"))).build();`

why `allMatch`? this doesn't sound like it would work.

i think the issue is that the current `editContains` is using `allMatch()`, which i don't think is correct?

actually, i think a cleaner way may be to check the index first, if index is wrong then throw a parse exception for index related stuf (ie `DeletePatientCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE`, only after index is confirmed to be good, then parse for forceDelete.

this is because currently the emphasis of the parse exception message usage being returned isn't very clear, 
ie if user keys command `delete-patient --force notAnIndex`, this method returns a `ParseException` with `FORCE_DELETE_MESSAGE_USAGE`. Emphasis of the exception should have been on the Index being wrong instead,

i don't think there's a need to have a new class for this? i think it is fine to have these constants be in `TimeslotParser.java`

@Jacob-Pang for input

at most, i would probably make it an enum with a field, ie
```
enum TimeslotRegex {
    DATE_SLASH_SHORT ("([0-9]{2})/([0-9]{2})/([0-9]{2})"),
    DATE_SLASH_LONG ("([0-9]{2})/([0-9]{2})/([0-9]{4})"),
    DATE_DASH_SHORT ("([0-9]{2})-([0-9]{2})-([0-9]{2})"),
    DATE_DASH_LONG ("([0-9]{2})-([0-9]{2})-([0-9]{4})");

    private final String regex;

    private TimeslotRegex(String regex) {
        this.regex = regex;
    }

    public String getRegex() {
        return regex;
    }
}
```

you could then access the first regex by: `TimeslotRegex.DATE_SLASH_SHORT.getRegex()`

you could even take this a step further by having an abstract method in the enum, eg. maybe `formatterExpression`, with each indiviudal enum having their own implementation of `formatterExpression` (returning a different formatter string) so you could shorten the if/elseif testing in `parseFormat`

I'm assuming the method is named `parseStudyLevel` to be uniform with the rest. However, for study level, it isn't exactly '_parsing_', since it's `String` -&gt; `String`. As compared to say email, where it's `String` -&gt; `Email`.

Perhaps without changing method name, we could change the description to "Sanitize/Clean studyLevel input"? or something along that line. Don't think it's a big issue tbh, but what do y'all think?

I think 'UI shows updated student list' comes before 'Logic saves the address book to the storage', according to the code:

```
commandResult = command.execute(model);

  } catch (IOException ioe) {
      throw new CommandException(FILE_OPS_ERROR_MESSAGE + ioe, ioe);

Not too sure if the 'Overlapping session will return an error' is necessary. But the 'takes care of overlapping session' also sounds very ambiguous (like we have some algo or something).

This is more of aesthetics, but would be great if we can do sth like:
`sessionType.setStyle("-fx-background-color: &gt;color>");`
and give different colors for R & I.

Then, add padding for `sessionType` label in the fxml.

Just some aesthetic improvements, not necessary if too rush!

Would suggest to abstract:
```
populateTuitionList(studentList, tuitionList);
sortByDate(tuitionList);
populateUpcomingTuitionListView(tuitionList);

If this function checks for whether it's within today, tomorrow and the following day, do we need to pass in the parameters `today` and `dayAfterTomorrow`? cuz probably can use `LocalDateTime.now()` and `LocalDateTime.now().plusDays(2)`.

right... i see where you're coming from. i doubt there's an issue with code quality, just that i personally feel that it's abit odd to be named `isWithinThreeDaysRange` and we have to indicate today+2days (`dayAfterTomorrow`) date as well haha

on second thought: MUST the `dayAfterTomorrow` be today+2days? will it break if another dev inputs a random date? maybe assertion will be good here then.

Actually now that I think about this again, maybe we should build a new temporary student from scratch, add it to the list of students temporarily, then feed it through `GetMonthlyFeeCommand` and compare the results with a 'hardcoded' result.

I think can imagine the listener as something that's running in the "background" and always monitoring the `ObservableList&gt;Student>`, so whenever there's any changes to the list of students, the code within the block will be invoked. As for the `change.next()`, if there are multiple changes made, they're represented as a 'separate change' (list of changes), so `change.next()` loops through it (might not be 100% correct in this part).

The `ListView&gt;Session>` is actually bound to the `ObservableList&gt;Session> sessionList`, so whenever there's a change in the sessionList, which is shown in this block of code you commented, the ListView will update as well.

_(might not be 100% correct)_

Actually just thinking what would happen if we put the time as 23:592.

Ohya actually is find_session part of v1.2? Cos now that I think about it, its quite weird for find_session to include the Index. Like it wouldn't make sense for me to look through the whole list of session and try to get the individual index and then run find_session again, cos the information we give from the session list and find_session would be exactly the same. It would make more sense for it to be just find_session s/STUDENT_NAME. But if this is not under v1.2, I think we should comment this out first before we discuss again?

Hmmmm already, actually didn't use super often so not sure how it would work out. We could keep this in mind and when the rest of us work on features that uses recurring session, see if we are able to perform all the actions we want, even w/o keeping a reference to it ba.

Also I am just wondering if there could be a way (Probably through a command) to add a recurring session into to application, so that the reviewers can checkout and run the PR to perform manual testing as well, to better understand your implementation. Not sure if you want to work on that first before we reveal and approve this to ensure that the implementation passes some light testing. If not it might be hard for me and jonah to test if our feature works if we couldn't add recurring session inside to the addressbook to test.

Maybe you would want to pull upstream first and merge inside, I believe that choon wei added a functionally that previously adding session that clashes. (E.g. If a session that starts on 2020-01-01 12.00 that last for 120mins, we can't create another session that is between  2020-01-01 12.00 to 2020-01-01 13.59) Although, with recurring session, this is much harder to achieve, because we need to take into consideration from the start to end date, if adding this rec_session will clash with future individual sessions as well. Not sure if you want to push the 2nd part into a separate issue as it seems like quite a big implementation.

Ohya one of the possible issue is that I think the storage has no way of identifying now whether a session is a recurring session or a standalone session. I tried creating the recurring session, close the app and open it again, and the recurring session becomes a standalone session now. Might need to take the storage into consideration, either in this iteration, or as a separate issue.

Hi thanks for the hard work. One of the bugs I found was that if I were to put a value where the end date and start date doesn't match, instead of showing an error message, an exception occurs. I think for this, it would be better to show some form of error message to the user instead.

Hi, so sorry, but I am not sure where the error is.

However, if you run the command:
add_rec_session n/Alex Yeoh d/2020-03-03 t/12:00 k/90 s/Math f/40 b/7 e/2020-03-17

then close the application, open the application again.

Run the command:
delete_session n/Alex Yeoh i/&gt;number of the recurring session>
You will notice that the output will be "Deleted Session: Date: 2020-03-03; Time: 12:00; Duration: 90; Subject: Math; Fee: 40.0" instead of "Deleted Recurring Session: Date: 2020-03-03; Time: 12:00; Duration: 90; Subject: Math; Fee: 40.0; Interval: 7; Last Date: 2020-03-17".

Hence, the although the storage is storing the interval and last session value inside the json file, I think when the system reads from the storage, it creates a session instead of a recurring session. Might need to look into that.

Haha, not sure if it is possible to abstract further.

Hi, actually not sure where this bug occurs, but when I was testing I noticed there is a weird bug now. As seen below, I added a 1970 session to TutorBuddy, but then in sessions, it displays the date is 1971 instead. Its the same for other values where it +1 to the session. Storage still shows the correct value, so not sure if the +1 only comes in in the UI. Seems to happen in master also, u might want to give it a try.

Haha yeah I tot of before, but then I think at most there will only be 2 commands, one to get monthly fee for a particular month, one to get past 3 months fee. So not sure if it should be a section by itself. Although I think doesn't hurt to change ba. I will make the changes first then.

Hmmmm I followed https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html ah. I think the reason why they did that is that it is more sequential ah. A person who starts must know how to "get help" before even starting to learn about the commands. After trying out all the commands, he / she can then clear the application and then "start" actually using their own data for the application. Thereafter they can exit the application. This seems to be quite a logic flow. What do you think?

Haha ok! This code is moved to feeUtil, but then hearing ur advice, I have put an assertion that numOfSession >= 0 (Sometimes can be 0 depending on the period given). In this way, if we want to debug, we can just activate assertion, but then it wouldn't return an exception during normal activity.

O.o hmmmm, we sort of built the ALICE student from scratch also in typical students tou. I am not sure if creating another new student at this point for calculation would have any difference from using existing students for calculation. In regards to hardcoding the answer to check, I am not sure but then I don't really see hardcoded values in test case also, so not sure if its the correct way to do it ah. Thats y eventually I changed to this that seems to follow what the other test cases in AB3 do ah.

Hmmmm I think cos we are using a general step that is same across the rest of the use cases also, cos you will see this in other use cases also ah. So we probably don't need to specific what type of inputs, since it should be general enough to be use at other places also ah.

I tink previously step 2 is split into 2, it checks for student info first and then checks for valid input. But then we feel that the "checking" part can be consolidated into 1 single step and just classify it generically as "detects an error", cos when students don't exist, its technically an error as well. Hence this is what we have in the end. Or do you feel that we should still spilt them up again?

> LGTM.
> The Student Commands need to be updated after the addition of the Tuition class #40

Ok great! Should we merge this first? Since we are doing this in phrases, I think it makes sense that we merged inside after a functionality is done, compared to merging it when tuition + session + student is done together. I believe choon wei would have to reference this changes to work on the tuition class as well. Delaying the merging could mean that there will be alot of conflicts when we ultimately try to combine everything together.

Yes I did a rough search and it seems that it is possible that 32-bit system running java might have the 2038 error. Hence I think setting an upper limit to &gt;=2037 would be a good compromise.

Haha I agree ah! For the 3 month command thingy, I was also thinking that we might not need the command. So haven't added it to the UG yet. Probably can keep the command for testing purposes, and remove it after the UI that uses the 3 month function is done.

> LGTM!
> utterly minute also debatable so ignore if dont think so, but getFee might benefit from being inclusive on both inputs. looks like its change &gt; to &gt;=. oh but also the caller 

Ok ah. The reason why I didn't make it inclusive end is because it is easier to get the months fee. For example to get Mar fee, I can put 1 Mar start, and then plus 1 month to 1 Mar to get 1 Apr as the end. 

If it is inclusive, I will have to do it such that the end period is the end of the month, but then some ends at 28, 29, 30 or 31. So its much harder to do that. So for the purpose of monthly fee, I would tink this way is better.

Is there a need for taskType? 
Seems like a hacky way to keep track of subclass name and might not be best practice. We should instead be looking to utilise polymorphism to distinguish the different classes. If absolutely necessary, this should be an enum with final access modifier so there is no chance to change once assigned.

Actually, now that i think it i think it's ok to leave it like this. I feel CompletableDeadlineCard should deal with UI elements (what to display when the item is completed), and Todo class should stick to containing fields related to a todo object (boolean value of whether it's done or not).

it's not a tip though is a  feature  flaw  and i don't want to highlight it  in the features. I feel naming it separately and talking about how we can find contacts using group mate  name gives  a clear indication that they are separate entities.

Which methods are you referring to? There is no need for javadoc comments on getters and setters. Method with @Override tag inherit javadoc comments from superclass, and there is generally no need to add a javadoc comment unless the behaviour has been modified or there is something of note. e.g. equals, toString, hashcode.

I feel that this shouldn't be an exception condition because we should instead just ignore whatever that's not the first arg. So reminder 6 haha should just take it as reminder 6. on the other hand reminder haha 6 shouldn't work but it has been considered in ur try catch method below.

for this whole parsing right, perhaps you may wanna think about changing it to a prefix kinda thing. Say reminder d/3 reminder w/2, with that you will be able to use preambles and also prefix isPresent to do most of the checks here and I can foresee the code to be neater :)

Instead of first checking if the expiry date format is correct using regex, he parses the input right away and catches DateTimeParseException to determine if the specified input is a valid expiry date. I think it will still work as intended.

I think this way of checking would break if the user keys in "reminder  3" with 2 spaces instead of 1. This way " 3" your argument would be " 3" which would cause a number format exception which would be caught and eventually be thrown as a parse exception. Are we going to be strict about this? Currently, the other commands don't seem to take into account additional spaces in between prefixes and command word.

Nope. All this does is check if the detailedPerson is the personToDelete and if so, switches the tab to the upcomingEventsTab.

The limitation of such an implementation is that if they are not on the detailedPersonTab, (i.e. streaks tab) the details panel will still switch to upcomingEventsTab.

> Should `AddCommand` always return to the all person view?

Yes. As a user, after adding a new person, the natural intuition is to check that the new person has been added. While we have a confirmation message, it would be better to switch to the all persons view so that users can visually confirm that their new person has been added.

If they were still on the groups view, visual confirmation would not be possible as it takes another command to add the new person to the group.

> Should `DeleteCommand` still stick to the groups view?

Yes. Similarly, after deleting a person, the natural intuition would be to verify visually, by comparing the current list of people with the previous list of people they saw. If the person is no longer there, users can rest assured that the person is deleted.

If they were initially on the groups view, with 3 people. They would expect to see a new list of 2 people. Switching them to the all persons view would throw them off slightly as they are now presented with a list of potentially more people.

The logic is good :) possibly can do 2 things
1. Sort by maturity date too (to ensure that the assigned cheeses are matured)
2. Can just use a counter to count the cheeses instead of using `decreaseQuantity()`, seems a bit sketchy haha
3. I think the `setCheese` should be done else where maybe in the command (using `model.setCheese()`). The `getUnassignedCheeses` should only get the cheeses without updating anything yet

> So for the architecture diagrams, nothing has changed actually, so I will use the same diagrams as before. For the edit commands implementation, I might add a sequence diagram, but that would be very similar to other commands like Add and Delete. I would feel that an object diagram, to explain the dependencies between the models would be more relevant to my content, but that might be covered under the model designs?

But you would have to come up with something that you have worked with before, so I think would be best to add the sequence diagram

One more comment: for Insurance Policies, can we also add into the UG saying that they are uniquely identified by the PolicyID and PolicyURL pair? So this means that the user can enter 2 policies of the same ID, but link them to different documents.

This is currently being done in the code.

I noticed in the code that duplicate input for tags are simply ignored. Perhaps in the UG we might want to add that duplicate/repeated input will be ignored for tags and policies? Since these two can accept multiple objects, as compared to repeated address/names/phone numbers, where we simply choose to take the last input.

Does this mean that the results will not be sorted by similarity anymore? Meaning that the order in which find returns will be based on the original order of the list?

If that is the case, I don't think "dictionary order" would be applicable here since [it means alphabetical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_order). Maybe not mentioning that the items will be sorted will be clearer?

**Git Commit Name Convention**

We will stick to conventional commit style, but we will capitalize the first letter after the colon.

Recommended examples:

- docs: Update [readme.md](http://readme.md)
- docs: Update [README.md](http://readme.md)

The general consensus is that if it conveys what this commit does, it's fine.


**Git Branch Naming**

Naming of the branch doesn't really matter as long as it makes sense.

https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html

If a branch is related to an issue, it is recommended to use the format `{issue number}-some-keywords-from-the-issue`

Recommended examples:

- docs/69-update-readme
- feature/22-add-storage-backup

**Pull Request Naming Convention**

No specific PR naming convention, as long as it conveys information on what that PR does.
Can use conventional commit style or write your own short description.

For point 3, I'm not exactly sure that is within our control? I've tried on Windows (logged in), macOS (logged in), Ubuntu (not logged in, Thunderbird installed) and on Ubuntu.

On Ubuntu, it will first open up the default browser (FireFox) and subsequently opening up Thunderbird, prompting me to login.

So I believe that on most OS, if the user is not logged in, the mail client will prompt the user. I feel that I don't have to document that down.

I was thinking of doing that, however I feel that it may conflict (visually) with the active state. Maybe we could add in a new icon somewhere to indicate that selection status?

While testing @ commit 72cdf3e623021fb07025ad089c1f9dfd58f05bb7, I found some bugs

1: Is the `find` command supposed to be deleted in this scenario?

The current issue with Outlook for Windows is that is is reliant on semicolons as a list separator (source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12120190/what-is-the-best-separator-to-separate-multiple-emails). The only way around that is to manually enable "Commas can be used to separate multiple message recipients" in Outlook settings.

hmm correct me if im wrong, but youll be adding the raw workload of each task to the module?

hmm i definitely agree with you that we shouldnt stay in the middle.

When implementing the recur command, I thought it was a good to have a command on its own because:
1. Personally, i would have more 'one-time' tasks than recurring tasks if im using a a task manager. E.g. we would only have 1 _assignment 1_ in a module. So for recurring tasks, realistically speaking, it should be made into a command rather than just a normal field like 'workload' for example. This is also a justification we can give for the criticism on 'why does _recur_ have to be a command on it's own' if we get it?

2. With regards to your 1st problem, I am not quite sure as to why the book will stop updating weekly? If a task is recurring weekly, it will refresh the deadline every week regardless, no? Might need some clarification there haha sorry

3. The second scenario is actually a v important consideration. One possible implementation can be when a user marks task as _done_, we can update the deadline (and remove starttime maybe), so that the user can see the next deadline already? what do you think? Another possible solution would be to maybe add a _next deadline:_ field in the task card which is way simpler i think?

For the refresh command, i think it is a bit unsafe to add a new command with only a day left because I think quite a few changes would need to be made? and we only have (only a day at most) to implemement the feature? I am scared that it will be too tight for v1.3 deadline? 

Overall, I am still fine with either though cuz for me, both ways work fine and (i think) either way can be justified hahaha

This looks like the same thing to me as onSessionDate (but without the assert), with different input.
Perhaps rename both methods to reflect this difference in input, or just let them be overloaded methods

this is because ( i think) there exists some overlap if n only if

The diophantine equation ax+by=c, has solutions if and only if gcd(a,b)|c.

You are probably right about the Model component; it would be good to be together with Student. I think i'd take SessionClassDiagram out of the DG for now.
About the feature:
I did this because  creation then a deletion does not each sound like a different feature (if feature is the word used) rather only difference in the command, which may not even need 2 seq diagrams like there already is, i felt. we shld discuss

Maybe is just the phrasing confusing. So in the latest commit I phrased the main info as
* If provided with tags
  * Delete every person who is tagged with the specified tag.
  * If the person is tagged with another tag, only the specified tag will be removed. The contact will not be deleted.
 
 Then for these examples, I left it as
* `delete -t colleague -t cs2103` deletes contacts with tag "colleague" and contacts with tag "cs2103"

Cos the happy path is to delete the contact. Then ONLY IF it is tagged with another tag then the contact is not deleted.

Could not find a simple way to make tags the outer loop for `containAllTags()`.
So kept persons as the outer loop for both All and Any, for readability.
However, made use of `TagsContainsExactTagPredicate` as suggested for better abstraction (demeter law)

@pyuxiang , for `list` tags will not be case-sensitive right?
Only enforcing for `delete -t` and `edit --remove` to avoid unintended deletion.

However, for `list` still case-insensitive for convenience of searches

@pyuxiang Unfortunately for those commands i think is inevitable. Cos wouldnt make sense to not show the contact that u just added.

unless,  one way could be to retrieve the predicate and `.or()` the added user?
Maybe create an issue if we decide that this is a bug

Im not really sure for the full range of accepted domain types. But some suggestions.

For `smtp.google.com.`, is ending with a `.` valid? if not can domain regex to `"[\\w-]+(\\.[\\w-]+)*$"`
Enforces that `.` must be surrounded with one or more `\w`
`a.b.c` allowed
`a.b.c.`, `.a.b.c` rejected

For false positive `-` . isit cos `-` need to be surrounded by letters, if so can `"((\\w+(-\\w+)*)+\\.?)+$"`
This enforces that `-` need be surrounded by `\w`. basically using same idea as above
`a-b.com` allowed
`a-.com`, `-a.com` not allowed

If combine both condition above, `"(\\w+(-\\w+)*)+(\\.(\\w+(-\\w+)*)+)*$"`

> The new message is clearer, though do we want to standardise with the other invalid index message? eg. 0 and 20 are both "invalid indexes" but show different error messages. But both works lah

Technically not same case leh, cos 0 is not valid index (same case with `-1`, `abc` etc) but 20 is a valid index that is not in the addressbook.
Thats why 0 causes "index invalid" but 20 causes "person index provided is invalid"

But idk maybe can somehow make clearer haha

> Essentially just playing very very safe here in case someone want to find fault with our validation. If we want, can add a `[^\W_]` right after the `@` to enforce alphanumerics.

Makes sense. i think  either `"(\\w[\\w-]*\\.?)+$"` or `"([^\\W_][\\w-]*\\.?)+$"` works. whichever u feel more readable. i didnt test tho haha
Edit: oh wait got diff. first one allow u to start label with `_`, second one doesnt.  Use whichever is more appropriate

actually right, i tried to use your onSessionDate() method but because I needed to pass SessionDate in as input, i found it very troublesome to use it. My this build method has the added benefit that it uses the time info of the recurring session, so i don't have to retrieve it, create a new SessionDate and then pass it into the onSessionDate() method.

> Yeap LGTM. Just 1 small comments on adding comments to the equals method. Previously in the group, I think shion also mention that changing the session to store student instead of having student store session could be a possible idea. If we somehow decide to do that, not sure if some of the test case needs to be changed. However, at this point, it might not be time efficient to change, might need to discuss this future when we meet tmr, to see if there is a point in doing that. Else, looks good

I think regarding this, wouldn't it be better to just have these test cases now and modify them later if we were to introduce the functionality?

> LGTM, tried out the new UI and its looks great to me. Only has some minor suggestions for you to consider. We could possibly change the reminder to show for the next 3 days instead of the next week instead, once calendar is up, as it wouldn't make sense for both to show the dates for the next 1 week ah.

Can change also, but the main difference is that the calendar should show the week (Mon - Sun), whereas the reminder shows one week from today.
Added benefit for having a Calendar is that it would allow the user to have a sensing of the frequency of tuition sessions for a particular week.
But I agree with you that reducing the period to 3 days improves the functionality of the Calendar.

I think there's a good chance more tests will be breaking given how the `header` and `data` attributes have not been implemented yet. At the same time, I am also hesitant about commenting out all the test cases.

The consideration I have is that making several small fixes to pass them might be easier compared to having to make a single big change to all test cases at the same time. Depending on the implementation for `header` and `data`, ensuring the test cases pass now may prevent further complications down the road. Just a thought :D

I think the issue for this is #526, in which the user brought up a valid point that reading the tip as it is makes the highlighting seem mismatching (since the compulsory prefix did not appear in the example that immediately followed it). I think arguments can be made both ways so safest option might be to split things up like in the `find` command although the difference for `run` is not as complex.

There's no check for header to be in json format. As an example, the header will be added in this format: `-h "Content-Type: application/json"`. That said, when retrieving the individual key and value, I noticed that this was what I got: `["Content-Type: application/json"]`. Hence, I trimmed the brackets and quotations to obtain the key and value. Ideally, the headers should be processed before being stored but until then this will still work :D

@tlylt Thank you for taking the time to scour through the changes :D It is indeed a lot of updates at once and I should have provided more context in the PR message. Regarding the points you raised, here are some of the missing context (which have now been included in the original PR message as well):

1) The refactoring was done partly through IntelliJ and partly by hand, and during the refactoring by IntelliJ, certain imports were automatically changed (such as the one involving `Messages` and `CollectionUtil` that you mentioned). I have previously combed the files in general but a few of these change in imports were not caught (though the latest commit should have caught all if not most of them).

2) The change of `seedu.address` to `seedu.us.among` was a result of a brief discussion but it has not been cast in stone, so please feel free to suggest alternatives to the package names :D

3) Finally, this PR changes only names and terminologies with no update to the logic at all so test cases would still need a separate update eventually :&gt;

Hopefully these help provide more context :D I'll proceed to merge the PR for now and we can do a future PR to rectify stuffs if necessary, thank you!

Ok I renamed the logic classes under `endpoint` and renamed the `execute` method to `send` as well which sounds more apt: `new GetRequest(endpointToSend).send();`

@tlylt I tinkered around with this as well. Unsure if there is any lag reduction but I imagine we can play around with the initial text to set in the box to mask this from the users. The counter is just a placeholder, I will likely replace it with `Processing Command...` (the dots will change between having 1 to 3 dots to reflect progress). Just 2 key points I wish to bring up:

- Firstly, although it works, the current code implementation feels rather messy because I had to wrap `Platform.runLater` a good 4-5 times around codes. If you had a better way to implement this, I'd love to hear it. If it helps, the reasoning behind my many uses of `Platform.runLater` is to deal with an error saying ` not on FX application thread; currentThread = Thread-4`
- Secondly, I did the UI threading within the `MainWindow#executeCommand` but this would mean that **sometimes**, even the fast commands like `add` and `remove` will see a quick flash of the counter (the pseudo progress indicator currently). Resolving this within `MainWindow` would look very messy as well. I am also still looking for a way to improve this.

I will tidy up and abstract parts of the code as much as I can tomorrow and try my best to make a PR before the team meeting so that we can further discuss this.

- I'll make a PR really soon to remove the wait time :3
- Shifting `Platform.runLater` above the sleep code removed the lag (which came from the initial 1 second sleep)
- Yup the entered command stays in the command box when frozen :D

> Not sure if I am getting this right, the request is cast to HttpPost for all the requests?

The `setEntity` method is unable to be called on `HttpUriRequest` and hence the casting. Whether this casting will be universal will be looked at again when more methods are added. If there is a need to then further abstraction needs to be done here :D

Note:
- User header input needs to be enclosed in quotations for example: `-h "Content-Type: application/json"`.
- Need to remove above mentioned quotations before storing.

Important:
- The second change directly affects the `parseHeaders` method within `HeaderUtil.java`. When updating this, change the following line:
  - Before:
`headerString = headerString.substring(2, headerString.length() - 2);`
  - After:
`headerString = headerString.substring(1, headerString.length() - 1);`

I think it's alright we can leave it there and hopefully it will appear again (happened twice to me so far) so that we can look at it. I am thinking to catch the stackoverflow error but not sure if that's actually legitimate.

Another update, I tried both `appendText` as well as `ListView` instead of `TextArea` in our `ResultDisplay`. In all cases, the lag still features prominently and because the bug is not deterministic, I am also unable to tell if either of them actually fixes anything. With all that said, I have come across quite a number of threads discussing about the performance of JavaFX and in particular, it seems `TextArea` is not good for very lengthy strings. In fact digging deeper there's quite a lot of criticisms for JavaFX performance. With all that said, I will likely opt to catch the stackoverflow exception.

Note: I cannot tag prof damith here but I'll find time to clarify if this can actually be considered a bug of ours. If truly it is because JavaFX is unable to support such lengthy input without crashing, then hopefully it might be considered an inherited bug.

My concern is that this might be considered a bug as if we consider the fact that our application causes "loss of data" when calling an endpoint. Will really need to clarify soon.

Ok nvm I misinterpreted this. List command does seem useless given how our list is always showing, but without list, if you do a find command and get a subset of endpoints you have no way of going back to seeing all endpoints again. This is unless find command supports a wildcard search or defaults to showing all endpoints if no arguments are given but at this point it seems easiest to just keep list.

The endpoint associated with this error returns a response body of length above 800000 and infrequently crashes in JavaFX when `setText` is called. There seems to be no better way to improve performance for this in JavaFX (have tried `ListView`, staggering the setting of text etc). As this lies with performance issues in JavaFX, it is more practical to address this in our requirements where we "cap" the length of response body for a reasonable performance of the application to be less than 100000.

Just putting a note here for now:

The reason for the above difference in error messages is due to how the `requests` library handles these 2 URL. The former contains alphabets and thus the library attempts to resolve the IP address it is referring to so that it can connect to it, throwing an `UnknownHostException`. The latter contains only numbers and the library treated it as an IP address to connect to directly (aka no need to resolve hostname) but also fails to establish a connection, throwing a `ConnectException`. This error mis-match can be easily fixed since the former is merely a more specific error message than the latter. The decision to standardise using the latter as the common error message is to be discussed with the team during the weekly meeting.

Just a note:

The DG mentions that this application is able to support up to 100k length from the response body. This artificial limitation is due to JavaFX's textarea being terrible at handling large input. The Youtube link above returns nearly 500k lines though sadly, the DG is not included in this PE-D. That said, let's forcibly trim the response output if it exceeds 100k in length.

Just a note:

The space between each prefix is necessary for differentiating between the end/start of different parameters input. The missing space between `address field` and `-d` above would naturally mean that the entire string there gets interpreted as part of address and thus prompting the error above. Finally, this error message also accurately points the user to where the error is (the address field) which would be more than enough for the user to notice the missing space.

Great suggestion, a link to the JSON format appendix should be added in the first instance of the word `JSON`. That said, this is more of a nice to have and not a bug as the JSON format is still sufficiently linked and explained in the rest of the document.

Just a note:

JAR file needs to be ran at least once and with data modifications for the folder to appear. It also makes sense that if the application has not even been ran then that there should be no data. This should apply to most if not all tP projects. That said, the UG can go a step further to clearly state this.

The space is actually present in the error message above (copy paste to verify) and if users follow the exact same format, there would not be an issue. Not entirely sure that this needs to be explicitly mentioned given that many other areas such as prefixes also make use of this whitespaces for distinction in their examples.

Just a note:

This was discussed within the team before and the consensus reached is that endpoint with the same URL, method type, header and data might be used for different purposes (identified with a tag). Let's say the tag represents a project that the endpoint belongs to. In this use case, differentiating endpoints with tags would be relevant to keep endpoints organised for different projects.

Try stashing your changes and running `add`, `edit` and `show`. They reveal more details than the `send` and `run` commands such as `header`, `data` and `tag`. `show` is suppose to show every single detail of the endpoint whereas `send` and `run` only shows the endpoint and response fields. The current changes removes these details from the textarea, giving the impression that everything is the same.

@ong6 The diagram/information are largely accurate but just some very minor considerations for `Add/Find` implementation:
- For the sequence diagram, the return arrow from `AddCommand` has the label `u` even though it should more appropriately be `a`. That said, the name given to the AddCommand instance should also be `a`, if we were to follow the style of the addressbook.
- This phrasing sounds a bit off "Upon the users entry of the endpoint", perhaps something simpler like "When the user adds an endpoint" will sound better.
- The URL used in the add command section differs a lot (a total of 3), let's stick with one perhaps just `google.com` so that it's easier for others to read. In particular, the URL mentioned in the steps does not match the one shown in the sequence diagram.
- Capitalisation in the `Find` activity diagram is inconsistent.
- May want to add in design considerations for `Find` command since its function is quite complex.

That's all :D

Hello! I apologise for appearing uninvited, I was really curious about the status of my bug reports. With regards to the editing of the data file, I actually came across this page stating the [tP constraints](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/admin/tp-constraints.html#tp-constraints). One of the constraints listed was `Constraint-Human-Editable-File`, which seems to imply that the application needs to fail gracefully when an invalid data file format is found. 

Thus, I am not sure if specifying that users cannot touch the data file might violate this constraint. Perhaps it is best to clarify with the prof first? :3 I would personally be interested to know as well :P

I would say it's not impossible but the purpose of adopting a light theme was to allow the greying out of expired property and appointments to be somewhat observable yet inconspicuous. The grey effect in the already Black/Grey DarkTheme would probably not achieve the same effect. However, if you guys are keen on a dark theme, I can consider a DarkTheme design in a subsequent update- maybe keep the DarkTheme.css file for now

If Order has a cheeseType property, then I would assume that one order should only have one type of cheese. Then, I think there should be some checks to ensure this?

An alternative would be to let an Order have multiple cheese types. If so, then we will have to remove the cheeseType property.

I think we need to account for the case where the input cheeseId no longer exist.

For example, suppose we have order with OrderId 3 that has been fulfilled with cheese with CheeseId 3.
- The user first deletes the cheese with CheeseId 3.
- The user proceeds deletes the order with OrderId 3, which brings us to the code block above.
- The above for-loop is unable to find the cheese with ID 3, since it has been deleted previously.
- this.targetIndex is set to Index.fromZeroBased(1), the default value.
- The wrong cheese is deleted.

I think we should "unfilter" the order list here? That is, calling model.updateFilteredOrderList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ORDERS). This is so that we can iterate through the complete order list when finding orders to cascade-delete.

This is so that when the findorders feature is implemented in the future (which will cause the order list to potentially be incomplete), this command can still work fine.

We might not be able to use Index.fromZerobased(0) as the base case representing that a cheese is not found.

In the below for loop, if the matching cheese is in index 0, then we will need to use Index.fromZeroBased(0) as the targetIndex.

So, need to either change the base case or the loop below.

The two ways when handling invalid data file:
1. Data file not in correct format -&gt; warning -&gt; start with an empty address book.

I think we can add in a case to handle when the user keys in an expiry date but not a maturity date when adding a cheese.

Anyway, since we are at this topic: I was thinking, we may want to consider dropping certain attributes from the models. For example only, since we have only 1 week left to add features, I think we may not have the time to implement features that deal with the cheeses' manufacture date, maturity date, etc.

We can always leave the clean up to v1.4, so it's just something to think about now? Should discuss more during Saturday's meeting.

I think it's okay if the cheese ID does not currently exist?

Consider the following scenario:
- User adds a new cheese (CheeseID = 1, CheeseType = Gouda, Quantity = 1)
- User adds a new order (OrderID = 1, CheeseType = Gouda, Quantity = 1)
- User completes Order 1 with Cheese 1.
- User deletes Cheese 1 (we currently allow this to happen without changing the order to which the cheese was assigned).
- User close the app.
- User reopens the app and runs into an IllegalArgumentException because CheeseID 1 no longer exist.

We can also check to ensure that an incomplete order's cheeseIds is empty.

If not, the app can start without errors or warnings even when there's an order in the data file like this:

This one you and Li Quan can decide? or you want to wait until Saturday to discuss also can.

And then, actually a cheese manufacture date don't necessarily have to be after an order's order date right? Are you referring to the order's completed date instead? If so then sounds good!

It's quite hard to make changes to the UI and test them in this current branch, the reason being we cannot yet create observable lists of orders or cheeses. 

Is it okay to merge this branch first? Then I can create another branch, rebase on the new storage branch and work on the UI right away.

If I remember correctly, the "As a" part don't have to be a user. So in this case maybe we can do: "Cake Collate/Program". But, I tried to find this in the lecture notes/textbook and couldn't find it.
So, maybe we can omit the "So that"/benefit part instead of "(obvious)", since it was mentioned in the notes benefits can be omitted if they are obvious.

Hmm.. By right the data shouldn't change while the user is in the help panel. But it wouldn't harm to insert redundancies so that the program won't break if for some reason data was changed during the transition. So, I would recommend using this fillPersonListPanel() to populate the personlist panel.

Ahhh, I see. We were told cyclic dependencies are bad practices in 1101 right? While its a bad practice I think it is still used haha if you take a look at w8 topics the first video for drawing class/object diagrams, they have cyclic dependency also: box and lid.
Maybe if you want to, you can change the resetMainWindow method in MainWindow to a static method then use a static call in HelpCommandPanel. Not sure if that is still cyclic dependency lol. Else if you really want to resolve it I guess you need an association class.. So, goodluck!

You can maybe merge this two if you are not trying to differentiate the reason why there is a parse failure (since you are throwing the same exception). In a way the error message will be less meaningful but it is what the original coder(s) did too for AddCommandParser etc. We discussed this briefly during our last meeting when @pPris brought it up. I think for now we are KIV-ing and maybe changing it if we have time.

1. Maybe for extensibility. Having a prefix in place now means in the future if we want to add another prefix it can be easily done.
2. Maybe so that user can input more than 1 request per command. Without the prefix, the user may have to use the command twice to input 2 different requests.
I think it's fine leaving it as it is now :)

Uhm because I wanted to let the user be able to search for a date using any of the format they use when they add the order + if they input the day/month/year only. Though now that I look at it I probably can do away with day/month/year since they are already included in the 4 formats provided haha. Also, yeah probably can create a method in deliverydate to get formats.

I would like to discuss if the command history should also include failed commands. I think there is merit to mimic the same behaviour where the invalid command can be access via up and down arrow keys so that a Power User can edit the invalid command rather than retype it all.

If we do go down this path, I think a possible implementation is that each history entry will keep a field to keep the corresponding command used. Thus, if the field is null, it indicates an invalid command, otherwise it indicates a valid command.

Just to clarify Policy_ means even if different insurance companies have different ways to label their policies, they should all be labeled starting with Policy_? E.g. company A labels policies P#12345, company B labels policies Life#7900, the respective policy ids in ClientBook would be Policy_P#12345 and Policy_Life#75900.

That is a great suggestion actually. 

One possible way would be to encrypt a password file using a secret key within our code which when the program runs, will be decrypted and stored in program state and encrypted immediately. 

The user can then enter lock without any parameters to lock using the old password.

However, I do feel that the effort to return ratio is rather minimal as it does not make our program any more tailored for our user than what already exists.

Good point there, I was looking at the same API a few days ago too. The methods ZipFile.isEncrypted() and ZipFile.extractAll() did not specify which type of ZipException was thrown. The try blocks are separated because I was using the second exception to return false, while the first try block was used to catch the error thrown when checking if the zip file is encrypted.

I have implemented the new feature of saving the old password. When the user calls the lock command to set a new password, the password will be stored in an encrypted file named keystore in /data/. 

After unlocking ClientBook, the next time the user tries to lock ClientBook without a password, the old password will be decrypted from the password file and added to the state of the program and the password file will be encrypted immediately.

How about "a client cannot own 2 policies with the same policy ID and URL."



> I noticed in the code that duplicate input for tags are simply ignored. Perhaps in the UG we might want to add that duplicate/repeated input will be ignored for tags and policies? Since these two can accept multiple objects, as compared to repeated address/names/phone numbers, where we simply choose to take the last input.

Added "if duplicate X are entered in a command. only 1 will be added to the client" in the attributes and identifier table.

The `change.next()` method controls the position of an iterator that goes through the discrete changes in the Student List. Whenever there is a change the listener catches these changes and triggers the contents of the `onChanged` function. The while loop will terminate after all tracked changes are iterated.

Yeah, I believe the "calling" to update the ListView is abstracted away in the implementation of ObservableLists in JavaFx under the Observable collections.

I think the reason why we're using ObservableLists is properly summarised in this [article](https://www.odiestas.com/en/understanding-the-use-of-observablelist-on-javafx/).

A `ListView` bounded by `List` will not update upon changes, but a `ListView` bounded by `ObservableList` will.

For the architecture sequence diagram, perhaps we can change it to a more generic example that @enhao25 sent on the group so that we don't need to update if we were to change commands formatting, and to use this diagram to show the interactions that occur for all commands. ☕

I will check again if there are conflicts with test cases. But the reason for the change was to fix a formatting for the study level field because currently some of the entries differ, eg.

Are you referring to line 58? I am aware of that and have thought about it and decided to add it in as well since it wouldn't make sense for me to just check for the range strictly between `sessionStartDate` and `sessionEndDate` and have the method named `hasOverlappingSession()`, though a change in method name to `hasOverlappingWithinSession()` may be possible.

I have decided to leave it for now, because if I were to remove equality checks, we would have to modify some logic in our test cases. So any test cases that are of the exact same time, should not be used for the test in overlap. A little counterintuitive, but yeah let me know what you think.

> I also noticed all the commands that @enhao25 changed to name it as ____StudentCommand got reverted. Is it intentional?

It is intentional if we were to follow the current implementation of Tuition class, where all student parameters are explicitly declare in the Tuition constructor.



> So there will only be 1 TuitionCommand which is the AddTuitionCommand right? The rest like list, delete, find, etc are still StudentCommands?

This is a mistake, good spot, should be AddStudentCommand.

> LGTM. Not sure if we still need the d in 'd:ListStudentCommand' in your UML sequence diagram. I think that d was used in DeleteCommand and it might be confusing here. I think the best representation is to remove the 'd's all together.

As per the UG `delete_session` delete session should delete tuition sessions (inclusive of recurring sessions). Perhaps the confusion is when `delete_rec_session` allows not to delete recurring session, but to a single session within a recurring session.

As mentioned in the UG, TutorBuddy is optimised for fast typing users with most of our controls replicable using commands.
There is no mention of clicking on the student, session, and calendar items in the UG because there is no intention of any additional functionalities at the moment. 👨🏼‍🍳

Nice spot! 

But then this would allow users to do edit 1 -tdog (without space), I guess it would be possible to remedy this somewhere else, but if I'm not wrong, the original AB3 code came with a "/t " (with space) so when changing to "-t " I kept the space as well. 

However, after checking out your commit, I think that the problems that the space brings are substantial so this is a good change overall!

Thank you for your valuable suggestion @deyixtan, our team has discussed the use of the prefixes and has decided to stick with `tag/` for the tag prefix and believe it should not take a toll on the usability of our product. Perhaps in future iterations after CS2103, we could consider relooking into this, nevertheless a good suggestion 👍

this feels like it should be not of an issue. The purpose of the information in the editing data file section is to remind/reiterate to the reader where the data would be stored, whereas in the FAQ it would part of a frequently asked question that the reader could easily search for.
It serves two distinct purposes, and thus should not be of an issue to repeat information.

personally, i think i would prefer 1 if i were a user but would also want to be alerted that there were erroneous fields however,  i think it would be best to follow the add command. Like if add aborts the whole command, i think edit should abort the whole command too just to be consistent

Maybe rename the boolean variables to  eg. isX, so that the variable name immediately implies a boolean value. In general it is clear that these are boolean values, but perhaps a rename would be safer to comply with the textbook recommendation.

Your suggestion sounds good to me! 

I am aware that some of the pre-existing boolean variables from AB3 might not seem to exactly comply with the textbook recommendation, and have thought about just leaving the variable names as is. However, I currently feel that it is better to err on the safe side, as it is always possible for the reviewer to argue that "just because it was originally named this way, doesn't mean it is correct". What is your opinion on this matter?

Oops, forgotten to include it in my PR description. I provided the reasoning in the relevant commit message, so I'm going to paste it here:

This change fixes bug where parser previously cannot distinguish
between eg. `-p` and `-pp`. Now, the parser can differentiate between
`-p ` and `-pp `, as `-p ` is not a front substring of `-pp ` due to
the whitespace char at the end of `-p `.

Accordingly, AddressBookParser has been modified such that it only
removes leading whitespaces, and no longer removes trailing
whitespaces. This is to account for optional options such as `-r `,
where `-r ` will not be registered as a valid key since the
whitespace char is trimmed away before the parsing of keys.

Not removing trailing whitespaces should not affect the eventual
values of the keys, as tokenizer will still trim the parsed value
before returning it. ie `-a test street            ` still results in
the address value being `test street`, without trailing spaces.

Thanks for catching this. I'll fix it up in my next PR, after checking the other commands that might be affected.

Thanks for pointing the errors out, I should not have assumed that these cases are already accounted for in the current testcases.  I will see how else I can fix this bug while preserving the Bash-like format. Changing this PR to draft until then.

Yeah I agree with your point, just thought it would be good to err on the safe side. Agree that this seems unnecessary, but I feel that it can serve as a fair warning to prevent "non-techies" from blaming us for what they (mistakenly) feel is a flaw in our app. What I had in mind is just a one-liner disclaimer eg. "The user must be logged into an email application to benefit from this feature.".

Hi Prof Damith, the javafx webkit and media packages are used to open HTML files from within the app. Our intention is to allow users to open the user guide (which is a .html file) directly within the app itself. May I know if the large file size is an issue (and negatively affect the grading)? If so, we will remove the packages and explore other options.

I noticed this as well, I found out that this always occurs after using SceneBuilder (probably auto-edited the fxml file to be v15). Did not encounter any issue regarding this matter, but I feel that we should edit the affected fxml files back to v11 before submission.

Wah I never knew there is such a contract. Will do it tomorrow!

For the third point I think it should be the other way round. Objects that are not equal should return different hashcodes as far as possible.

I think it should still be pretty safe to check for different hashcodes for different objects since it should be quite unlikely to collide. Do you think we should remove this check?

For the return statement of this method, the comments helped me to understand the code easily which is already great, but I was thinking whether the expression would be a little less complicated if you separate the boolean statement into multiple named boolean variables.

For example
```java
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        isSameObject = other == this;
        if (isSameObject) {
            return true;
        } else {
            isLockCommandObj = other instanceof LockCommand; // instanceof handles nulls
            isCurrentPasswordEqual = currentPassword.equals(((LockCommand) other).currentPassword);
            isNewPasswordEqual = newPassword.equals(((LockCommand) other).newPassword);

            return isSameObject || (isLockCommandObj && isCurrentPasswordEqual && isNewPasswordEqual);
        }
    }
```

If we remove the password here,  does that mean that every time the user unlocks the ClientBook, the next time he locks he needs to set a password again? 

If that's the case, then I'm thinking if it is possible that we don't remove password on unlock and store the password, so the user only needs to specify a password for the lock command when he/she first adds or changes his/her password. Then subsequently, if he/she locks and unlocks it will just use the same pasword.

edit: after thinking about this more, I realised that its not so easy to store the password securely within the app (I was thinking  in UserPrefs? but not sure if it is secure or even possible), and perhaps this one time lock and unlock is enough. What do you think?

This method is fine, but are the 2 try-catch blocks are mainly to differentiate between the 2 types of exceptions? I was thinking whether you can condense it into one try-catch block, and in the catch block, you differentiate the 2 cases using the ZipException that was caught.

Actually I was looking at the docs, and found that they didn't really specify what ZipException each method threw, but on their ZipException class, there is a getType() method, which returns a ZipException.Type. (https://javadoc.io/static/net.lingala.zip4j/zip4j/2.7.0/net/lingala/zip4j/exception/ZipException.Type.html) 

Perhaps you could check if it is possible to differentiate the cases by checking the exception type? If not then your method is completely fine as it is

I agree that the effort to reward ratio is pretty low since it's not a particularly core feature of our application. In that case, let's keep this extension in mind, and if we have time after other core features then we can possibly come back to it in the future.

A little nitpicking, but instead of leaving it as the default case, it might be better to specify each specific case, like

* The `CURRENT_PASSWORD` field can be omitted if ClientBook is not yet locked.
* When `CURRENT_PASSWORD` and `NEW_PASSWORD` are both specified, ClientBook verifies the current password before locking ClientBook with the new password.  &gt;- specifying this case instead of leaving it as default case
* When `CURRENT_PASSWORD` and `NEW_PASSWORD` fields are both omitted, ClientBook will attempt to lock itself using the last used password that is safely stored on your device.

By the way, I tried to update the data directly from the json file, but not sure if it is because of the zip, but it doesn't work. After I change the json file, I start up the app and it goes back to the previous state. Maybe you guys can test it also, and if it doesn't work, we just remove the "Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file." part

For these 2 methods, I thought it might be slightly inconsistent that all the other methods in ParserUtil class named parse... parses some string into an object, while these two methods trims whitespace and checks validity.

Ah right that makes sense, will change it

Edit: after thinking about it, i realise that putting it like that might imply that a flag can be specified for each policy, since the user can put in multiple policies. My implementation was no matter how many policies you put, you can only set 1 flag. e.g.` i/P123 i/P321 -remove` removes both

Just did some testing, feature works perfectly! The only small issue is when you input `unlock` without any parameters, the feedback message to user is 
```
Invalid command format! 
lock: Locks ClientBook with a password.
Parameters: CURRENT_PASSWORD(if any) NEW_PASSWORD
Example: lock 12345
```

And also I think maybe it would make it clearer for the user if we add in the user guide a sentence to specify that when lock is used without parameters, then it will be locked with the current stored password.

After these 2 then its LGTM for me!

This is a little confusing. By deleting the contact when no more tags exists, it suggests that contacts cannot have no tags. But what about a workflow where user wants to delete all tags, then assign new tags from scratch?

Should the `delete -t` command just deal with tag deletion alone, and not touch contact deletion at all?

I think using the current `add`, `find`, `delete` for contact processing is a good idea, like what you mentioned. That's essentially the existing commit: "deletes all contacts with at least one of colleague or cs2103 tags".

It's the proposed change that I don't quite catch, i.e. "delete tags in contact + delete contact if there is an exact tag match".

PS: On this note, going by your suggestion to use `tags` exclusively for tag, we can do tag deletion using the same command, e.g. `tags -d -t colleague -t cs2103`. Sounds like a pretty self-consistent idea.

> Cos the happy path is to delete the contact. Then ONLY IF it is tagged with another tag then the contact is not deleted.

What about the case where I want to delete all people with that tag? I can't quite think of a viable workaround for this, except manually searching for and deleting the person, e.g.,

```
# Removing everyone tagged A requires `delete 1 2` instead of `delete -t A`
1. John (tag: A)
2. Grace (tag: A, B)
3. Bob (tag: B)

There is an existing predicate for tag testing, if intending to integrate with the existing `Person` model. Will require addition of a new predicate to separately check for all tags.

## Non-functional requirements

Quality requirement: HippoCampus should be usable by a novice who has never used a CLI addressbook before.

HippoCampus should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts without noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.

Should store data locally only, in a human editable text file, for privacy reasons.

Technical requirements: HippoCampus should work on any mainstream OS with minimally Java 11 installed.

Notes about project scope: Should only be for a single user and should not require interaction with other users of HippoCampus.

A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

The source code should be open source.

Courtesy of @nickyfoo, cannot reduce automated tests until one iteration is complete, for grading purposes:
https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/admin/appendixE-gitHub.html#tp-workflow

> After following the given workflow for at least one iteration, optionally, you may adjust the process rigor to suit your team's pace. Here are some examples:
>
> - Reduce automated tests: Automated tests have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain. It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated tests you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much. There is no direct penalty for removing tests. Also note our expectation on test code.
>
> - Reduce automated checks: You can also reduce the rigor of checkstyle checks to expedite PR processing.
>
> - Switch to a lighter workflow: While forking workflow is the safest (and is recommended), it is also rather heavy. You may switch to a simpler workflow if the forking workflow if you wish. Refer the textbook to find more about alternative workflows: feature branches workflow, centralized workflow. Even if you do switch, we still recommend that you use PR reviews, at least for PRs affecting others' features.

Personally I'd avoid the highly ambiguous "11 Dec 02", partly because it's uncommon, and will succeed without raising errors for international users whose local formats follow "yy/mm/dd" instead of "dd/mm/yy". Perhaps enforcing the "yyyy" format will catch potential errors, or another option would be to allow users to customize the desired date format.

This might be a good reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country

Perhaps the formats we might want to support include the predominant little endian DMY format (exception is ISO format which should always be supported):

- "yyyy-mm-dd" ISO-8601
- "d.m.yyyy" German, Russian
- "d/m/yyyy" French, Spanish
- "d-m-yyyy" Hindi

with the associated long forms:

- "mmm d yyyy" USA (+ "mmmm d yyyy")
- "d mmm yyyy" Singapore (+ "d mmmm yyyy")

> Are we going to throw error if the user types in wrong specifications? like eg. `list -partial` or `list partial` or `list Bernice`. Currently if i'm not wrong it just ignores and lists all people in the addressbook

Thanks for spotting the bugs, you're absolutely right! At first was thinking of making space for the discussed `list 1 3` syntax, but that's not the scope of this PR. Have added changes to check for the required empty preamble.

Some notes:
- `list -partial` and the other variants above are now invalid.
- `list -partial -n john` will not be valid since the preamble `-partial` exists.
- `list -n john -partial` will be valid since the search term for name is now `john -partial`.
  - This issue cannot be avoided since this is fundamentally how the parser is designed, to only parse specified prefixes.
  - One way is to enforce regex validation, but we probably can't predict how [people name themselves / their kids](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/08/musk-grimes-baby-name/) :')

Technically the proposal does specify multiple tag removal, but the syntax didn't reflect it :p
1. If implementing, can use `argMultimap.getValues` in line 92 of `EditCommandParser.java`.

Probably not, since it increases the complexity of the command + the parser doesn't distinguish the absolute positions of the prefixes, so matching two prefixes will be a pain.

Throwing error is one way, and the ~~easy way out~~ other way would be to simply document this ~~behavior~~ feature (i.e. only the last sort prefix given is used), just like for the `add` command. Which do you prefer?

> I think we agreed that memory not really a concern atm since undo history doesnt carry over across sessions.

Floating an idea, what about (1) setting undo history to a cap higher than the average number of commands used in a single session, and (2) letting undo history carry over sessions? It's a little like vim's swap files.

Validation of the swap history can be achieved by storing the latest address book state in a lightweight hashed format, so it avoids users abusing the swap file to trigger invalid undos.

On that note, forgot to mention that if this is desired, there is a workaround for it, e.g. to sort by ascending birthday, and descending name if same birthday, can call these two commands in succession:
1. `list [...] [-s name] -o descending`
2. `list [...] -s birthday [-o ascending]`

Gave a cursory glance (no computer to test), looks okay. Note the date comparisons are a little different between EventDate and Birthday:

- EventDate should be sorted by date including the year, whereas Birthday is by month and day only. The compareTo method in Date should implement the absolute ordering, and Birthday to override this behaviour using getMonthDayString.
- When merging #126, the retrieval of the string date for comparison should return "" for empty Dates. This is noted in the PR description.

Did a quick field test (Person 1 has no fields, Person 2 has all fields populated), most issues from previous PR fixed.
Very nicely implemented! Note certain behaviors below that might need to take a relook (either in same PR, or in a subsequent PR if there is sufficient buffer).

### Behaviors: General

1. ✔️ `edit 1 --address` TAB -&gt; `edit 1 -a`
   - Long form prefixes are converted to representative short form. Valid, need to document.
2. ✔️ `edit 1 -r -r hey -r hi` TAB -&gt; `edit 1 -r hey -r hi` ENTER -&gt; change remark to "hi"
3. ❗ `edit 2 -n -r -e -a -p -b` TAB -&gt; `edit 2 -n NAME -r REMARK -e EMAIL -a ADDRESS -p -b BIRTHDAY`
   - Seem to have implemented all autofill except phone
4. ❗ `edit 2 -p 999` TAB -&gt; `edit 2 -p`
   - Phone number field is removed from input.

### Behaviors: Tags

5. ✔️ `edit 2 -t hello` TAB -&gt; `edit 2 -t hello -t TAG1 -t TAG2`
   - Existing tags are added. Valid, need to document (as opposed to replacing all tags with `hello`).
6. ❓ `edit 1 -t` TAB -&gt; `edit 1 ` TAB -&gt; `edit 1`
   - Tag prefix is removed from input. Valid, but extra spaces in output? Cosmetic issue.
7. ❓ `edit 2 -t` TAB -&gt; `edit 2 -t TAG1 -t TAG2` TAB -&gt; `edit 2 -t TAG1 -t TAG2 ` 
   - Tags are populated. Valid, but also adds extra spaces in output (as above). Cosmetic issue.

### Behaviors: Wrong command format

8. ❓ `list` TAB throws "Invalid command format". Upon invalid command/prefixes, should it ignore as well?

9. ❓ `edit -r hey` TAB / `edit 2 -test` throws "Invalid command format". Perhaps would be good to state "autocompletion requires command format `edit INDEX` and remark prefix `-r` to be specified.

And so is `u.nus.eduuuuuuuuuuuuuu`, by virtue of the non-existence of the `eduuuuuuuuuuuuuu` TLD. The RFC itself for determining a valid host/domain name is huge.

Regex, in my opinion, should be used as a means of providing a minimal level of client-side validation (or perhaps even restricting the scope of the product to ensure reliability of the product, see #245) to instill some user confidence in the product, not as the ultimate fallback to validate everything.

The only reliable way to authenticate a user is by doing an email verification exercise, which is not within the scope of this product (since this product is designed to operate locally).

Yes, you can give it a try in your own browser: [https://google.com.](https://google.com.)
The terminating period is part of a fully qualified domain name.

By specification if I recall correctly, just cannot start with hyphen. Also not too sure what the email address domain part includes a hostname (for the mail server) - if it's a pure domain name, then hyphens are not even allowed. Also dunno if a single period is allowed.

Essentially just playing very very safe here in case someone want to find fault with our validation. If we want, can add a `[^\W_]` right after the `@` to enforce alphanumerics.

Event should be edited based on their identifier, not their index. 
- Define another method getEventByIdentifier(int identifier, List<Events> events) to get the event by identifier
```java
Event getEventByIdentifier(int identifier, List<Event> events) throws CommandException {
    List<Event> eventsFilteredByIdentifier = events.stream()

You might want to consider converting the user input to uppercase as well, since currently, if user passes in `s/todo`, this would get rejected as they would need to do `s/TODO`, which might not be very good UX. 

If we uppercase the user input, then the user can pass in `s/tOdO` and it will still work.

Maybe the Name class contains the regex you're looking for? You could adapt the "\\p{Alnum}" in the Name regex to \\p{Alpha} . I'm basing that off this link (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) 

Also, I think when the parser part is done, it should be trimming any user input before the Type constructor is called so checking for spaces may not be an issue?

If these two classes are supposed to be the equivalent of CakeCollate.java and ReadCakeCollate.java, maybe this could be better named after the model name? so something like public class OrderItem(s) implements ReadOnlyOrderItems.

I think if we will never go into the else block then we can modify the if-else structure and use assertTrue(mapping.contains(module.toString())) above. Which seems like this:
```java
assertTrue(mapping.contains(module.toString()));
List<Task> newList = mapping.get(module.toString()); //must ensure Module exists in the listOfValidModules
newList.remove(task);
if (newList.isEmpty()) { //remove the module(key) from mapping if no task is associated with it
    mapping.remove(module);
} else {
    mapping.put(module.toString(), newList);
}
```
Do you think it's a good idea?

Here is my take on this:
The enum could return the DateTimeFormatters instead,
```
enum StandardDateTimeFormat {
    DATE_SLASH_SHORT ( "dd/MM/yyyy" )
    ...
    private dateTimePattern;
    private StandardDateTimeFormat (String dateTimePattern) { 
        this.dateTimePattern = dateTimePattern; 
    }

    public DateTimeFormatter getDateTimeFormatter() {
        return DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(dateTimePattern);
    }

    public String getDateTimePattern() {
        return dateTimePattern;
    }
}
```
Then, the parsing of the non-Next inputs could be performed like this:
```
public LocalDateTime parseDateTime (String input) {
    for (StandardDateTimeFormat standardDateTimeFormat : StandardDateTimeFormat.values()) {
        try {
            return LocalDatetime.parse(input, standardDateTimeFormat.getDateTimeFormatter());
        } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {
            continue; // no need for regex checking because check is performed by LocalDateTime.parse
        }
    }
    throw ParseException(...); // does not conform to any of the standard inputs
}
```
I really do not recommend having date and time parsed separately, but for discussion sake, one can implement 2 enums, standardDateFormat and standardTimeFormat and the loop can be modified like this:
```
public LocalDateTime parseDateTime (String input) {
    for (StandardDateFormat standardDateFormat : StandardDateFormat.values()) {
        for (StandardTimeFormat standardTimeFormat : StandardTimeFormat.values()) {
            try {
                DateTimeFormatter standardDateTimeFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(
                        standardDateFormat.getDatePattern() +  " " + standardTimeFormat.getTimePattern());
                return LocalDatetime.parse(input, standardDateTimeFormatter);
            } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {
                continue; // no need for regex checking because check is performed by LocalDateTime.parse
            }
        }
    }
    throw ParseException(...); // does not conform to any of the standard inputs
}
```

Does this mean we should create another command just to handle contact deletion and this `delete -t` command only deals with tag deletion? Basically similar to our `add`, `find` and `delete` commands that only deal with contacts while `tags` command only deals with tags.

if a user wants to remove a tag/data, they will most likely type

> I did a quick skim of the files and it seems that the whitespace removed from the likes of `PREFIX_METHOD` are instead being introduced in the strings they are being concatenated with. Am I overlooking anything?

Hi the only thing in the PR that affects code is the prefixs being changed in CliSyntax.java. For the add, edit and run, I just made the error command messages more readable, for example: from 
"add -xget -usomeurl -hsomeheader" to 
"add -x get -u someurl -h someheader"

> Okie @ong6 introduced the whitespace in `PREFIX_METHOD` in this [commit](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/commit/750905738da4644176a8ed3d54a5afdcd73ac6e9) 5 days ago so I think's best for him to do the review.

@ong6 so heres a more in depth view of whats wrong with PREFIX_METHOD = "-x "

using an example of "edit 1 -x "
when passed into the parseIndex method of ParserUtil.java, it calls 
string trimmedIndex = oneBasedIndex.trim(); which trims the string to "edit 1 -x".

then because PREFIX_METHOD is "-x " (with the space), StringUtil.isNonZeroUnsignedInteger(trimmedIndex) will be true, because trimmedIndex will be equal to "1 -x", which leads an exception of the EditCommand.MESSAGE_INVALID_INDEX being thrown, instead of a more specific error message from the parseMethod method.

Also, if PREFIX_METHOD = "-x ", doing "edit 1 -t " or "edit 1 -h " does not work to remove tags/header because of the same reasons as stated above.

TLDR: there should be no space in all prefixs, unless you want to change a ton of other codde

I think it would be better to change this form to use the standard if-else syntax. There are 3 reasons for suggesting this:

1. It improves readability of what the function is doing.
2. The code-base throughout does not use ternary operators in the `compareTo` or `equals` function. They typically write it out in full form.
3. The module's coding standards require if-else type statements to take a certain form: https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#layout

Thus, I would recommend changing it.

Similarly, would suggest changing this to composition.

In addition, perhaps it should be a dotted arrow as the main mode of interaction is through the hashmap, and so, similar to the storage diagrams, it should be a dotted arrow.

It designs choices if we put setdividerdictionary, setdividernote, setdividerontact, setdividermain. The command will eventually become too long and unusual in a long run. the 'intuitive' part does depend on experience, as user use the app more frequently, they will notice the same theme going on. n stands for note, d stands for dictionary, c stands for content, and m stands for m main screen. The same format has been given to multiple commands, hence the pattern is there for the user to learn. the command is also designed to be similar since they are the same command just working on a different component. to improve the intuitation, we will add note to userguide.

yes, it an intended by design.
If the user closes note content, why would it want to change the divider orientation in the first place? (they cant see the divider!)
The logical reason will be that the user will like to see the note content too.
Hence it is logical to open the note content, this way, the user will be able to see the result of the command as well.

since this behaviour is not stated as UG, it will be added.

the divider position is saved when you moved the position manually too.
open -a ensure all panel is visible, it does not reset the divider position, 
it will ensure the divider is back to it last known position.

This doesn't seem like a very robust check, since it would allow dates such as 2020-99-99, which would be an invalid birthday as well.

I think we could instead use the Java LocalDate class, which provides the parsing methods as well.

It seems like the method is doing more than it should, in the sense that it is checking if the person has tags, and adding it to editedPersons, which might violate some abstraction principles.

On that note, the method name is misleading, since it implies that it only checks if there are tags.

I would suggest to change this method signature to private boolean hasTags(Person personToCheck), which will return true if the person has the tags, otherwise false, and leave adding the person to editedPersons to the execute method

Method name is a little misleading, as it seems to imply a check (i.e. returns a boolean). I think this method shouldn't be calling deletedPersons.add(person), as it might violate some abstraction principles.

Ah I forgot about the app making matric number unmodifiable. 

What if we say that, while users can edit the matric number in JSON file even though the GUI doesn't allow, extra care must be taken to ensure data integrity. Specifically, if the user decides to edit the matric number of a student, they must either (1) edit any appointments for this student to reference the new matric number, or (2) delete all appointments linked to the student. 

Btw what would happen if I edit matric number in JSON and the matric number in appointments are not edited? We should specify the expected behaviour in this scenario somewhere in UG also?

Yup I don't think it's a contradiction coz the writing commands thru the GUI and editing the JSON are 2 distinct interfaces to interact with the application.

on a second thought, would it be better to repeat the information? the reason is that if a reader navigates directly to a feature, then they will know the relevant conditions for using this command. If we refactor and put this in the parameter format section, the reader might miss it. another alternative is to have an in-page hyperlink that directs to a subsection called "Conditions for valid appointments" (which would also talk about no clash and pre-existence of student etc.)

What do you think if we remove this line?

I thought more about this and wonder if this is a self-invocation, which entails calling another method of its own instance. If we remove this line then it would be that `AddressBook` is activated by the method call `addPerson()` from `Model`, then returns and gets deactivated.

Also can you update the image in DG to match the new sequence diagram?

These two commands have distinct usage. `find` searches by a unique identifier, that is the matriculation number, hence would return a unique student and their appointment if present. `filter` searches by a condition which can return non-unique values.

It is implemented with a separate command, but now that i think about it i should have probably implemented it with the add command lol i thought it would be neater to use a separate command to add requests instead of overloading the addcommand. In my implementation, requests are initialized to be empty at first and added with a separate command.

I think you must make a new class called `EntryTagContainsPredicate` which implements `Predicate&gt;Entry>` and do your implementation for filtering tags there, then pass an instance of that class as a parameter into the `updateFilteredEntryList` method.

Welcome to the User Guide of **Teaching Assistant**!

Are you a JC/Secondary school teacher, having troubles keeping track of all your consultations, meetings and your students' contacts? No worries! Our application, **Teaching Assistant** will provide an all-in-one platform for you to organise your entries _(tasks and schedules)_ and contacts!

Teaching Assistant mainly uses a Command Line Interface (CLI). This means that a user can use the application by typing into a Command Box. For users who type fast, they can use this application more efficiently than other applications that heavily use Graphical User Interface (GUI), where a user uses the application by interacting with graphical features such as buttons.

If you are interested, jump to [Quick Start](#quick-start) to learn how to learn how to start using **Teaching Assistant**.

I get what you are trying to do here. But your code here seems like you are comparing two items instead of comparing the item's quantity.

In my ItemExpiringPredicate Class i use a method called days.between to check for the difference in dates and it returns me a type long.

There are actually no ways of going about this. It's either I parse int to long in this class (which I did) or I parse long to int in my ItemExpiringPredicate Class. Since this class name is called ReminderCommandParser, I feel all the parsing should be done here hence I chose the first method.

We have to split the string because the parameter can go can be 1 or multiple digits so I just do substring, I have to abstract out the number. With input as "reminder 3 hahahaha", I still have to abstract out the 3 using split.

This wouldn't be the case. It will still work regardless of how many spaces are in between the reminder and the number.
Eg. "Reminder                 3" would work the same as "Reminder 3"

Basically, I abstract the user input string into arrays of string. The stringArgsArr[0] has to be a number in a string format and the stringArgsArr[1] has to be a "days" or "weeks". With these 2 valid arguments, I will proceed to parse the number of days in total. If no days or weeks are declared in the user input, by default the number given is in timeUnit days.

All right because initially, the plan we discussed was to make the input more lenient to allow the user to input "reminder 3 days" or "reminder 2 weeks". But I can make it work using prefixes as well, but I probably going to do it on another branch "Modify Reminder Feature" for v1.3

Conforming to RFC standards is not feasible due to the following reasons:
https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-seantek-mail-regexen-03.html#case-sensitivity-of-local-part, 
https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-seantek-mail-regexen-03.html#regular-expressions-for-email-addresses,
Also, there are multiple RFC standards, 2822, 5322, 6532, etc., each with conflicting rules. If there really is a need to implement a full blown check for ONE RFC spec, there probably is a need to write a lexer that parses emails, which is too time consuming.

A more elegant way of checking if an email is valid would be to send a mail to that address and expect some form of reply but that is overkill for this project. A simpler fix will be to keep the current `isValid()` function as it is and the onus is on the user to verify that the email is correct and update the UG accordingly.

This is the output from jshell: 
`String.format("%s hello", "%s bye", "test")$1 ==> "%s bye hello"`
As you can see string substitution is only applied on the first argument and does nothing to the `%s` in the replaced portion. There doesn't seem to be any situations that forces concatenation of email in the first argument so I don't see any issue with this.

```commandStrings == null``` is unreachable. The reason is because if ```commandStrings``` is ```null```, a NullPointerException would have been thrown when you called ```commandStrings.length()```.

This way to extract the index could potentially be problematic. For example, ```edit 1 2 3 -n``` and ```edit ! 1 -n``` will be counted as a valid index because any non-digit characters will be removed and they will become ```123``` and ```1``` respectively.

I think a better way to deal with this would be to first split the command and command arguments using a ```Matcher```.
You can reference the ```AddressBookParser``` for example on how it separates the command and the arguments.

After which, you can depend on the ```ArgumentTokenizer``` to get the preamble which will be your index.

@oeiyiping I have actually pondered over this for some time, did some research and decided to use the same class name.

As mentioned by @justgnohUG, since they are clearly differentiable by file path, and on top of that, there is an extremely low possibility that you will be referencing both Command classes in another class, I don't see any issues.

After testing the new prefix parsing implemented in this PR, I think there are fundamentally a few problems here, especially with the filter and alias command.

1) The filter command is having trouble working as intended. For example, if I want to filter by address, I would need to input ```filter -a ``` with whitespace behind.

2) Similar, typing ```filter ``` should clear all existing filters. However, without trimming the trailing whitespaces, the filter command will recognise the command slightly different and instead filter the list of persons to show just the name.

3) Alias commands are also having problems when parsing and checking the validity of the commands to be aliased.

I feel that its better to keep things simple, but if its too troublesome maybe we can state somewhere in the DG/UG on the 2 very similar commands. For @AiwassPrime and @umergta  2nd problem, I think the ModuleBook should check the deadlines and recurrence on every start-up so that the "updating" does not get stuck  after 2 months of not opening the app.

When the user input invalid parameters after a flag, the result is the same as `elist` and also displays a "Listed all events" success message. Optional though can consider to display another message to remind them about the missing field (can be error or just a message).
eg. `elist --any sdjsjhf`, or `elist --exact xcvxg`

Enhancement: Will address to users the purpose of putting elipsis in each review that is very lengthy 
=> Keep each entry window small
=> view feature is to be used to see the whole review

i.e. whenever an elipsis is present, it is because
1. A character limit is reached, and the review is truncated
2. A second review or more, exists

In this context it is not clear what review he added on. We suspect there are 2 reviews
1. Cheese fries ...  2. !!!11
It's not clear from the result display, that's a separate issue
But it's because of 2 reviews that the elipsis is used to maintain the short height of the entry window

Originally when I switched from the help page to main, I used fillPersonListPanel() in the resetMainWindow() function to fill in the vBox with the person list again, so as I was using it twice I abstracted it out. I changed it to re-using the same person list so I don't need it anymore but forgot to take out the abstraction.

Yup, I originally used the function to use from HelpCommandPanel to change from the help to person list there but it was quite inefficient to get everything from there so I ended up just sending a reference to the main window itself to help which is a cyclic dependency now that I think about it, oops probably have to change stuff then.

Interesting that you passed the message into the `parseIndex` method to create a custom error message. I think the alternative is the previous structure which is fine as well, as the exception of an index parsing error need not know which command it is in when the exception occurs. It is when the error is being caught at the higher level, the exception is transformed with added details of the command usage. Let's keep to what you have since this change affects various test cases. Just some thoughts.

@tjtanjin FYI I will experiment with this for an hour or two now. If anything I will update this thread.

Use of `Platform.runLater(new Runnable() { ...`  can schedule the execution and update of GUI to a later stage. But right now there is still some lack before displaying `Running test` and it does not seem to return immediately, which means the place to invoke the call seems to be important and needs to experiment more on this.

There are a few areas where we need to address, at least base on the coverage analysis report by IntelliJ. While some areas such as UI could be disregarded, we should try to cover those cases in Logic, Model, and Commons, possibly discuss further on specific work allocation in the afternoon meeting

Possibly discuss the progress on this task in the afternoon meeting. From my perspective, I think the UG styling & structure are of decent quality, largely thanks to @tjtanjin. If all features are finalized, perhaps everyone could go through the UG at least once again just to make sure no stones are left unturned.

Possible to explore a larger minimal screen size (in terms of horizontal constraint). I think a size that is larger but slightly smaller than a typical laptop screen size (1024px) should still be reasonable as the app will not be operating on tablets or ipads anyway. @AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/developers thoughts?

I think this is a great point, does it also apply for all other commands when user just do 'add ' or 'run '? If so we can probably give a parameter cannot be empty error as well.

### Implementation(Request)
---
@tjtanjin I think the diagrams and descriptions are very accurate. A few minor suggestions below:
- perhaps step 2 -3 can be rephrased to leave out some low-level details or make the overall flow clearer. I think the few components that are quite important are the following:
  - Create a EndpointCaller with the endpoint selected
  - EndpointCaller#callEndpoint()
  - Generate the right request object to be executed
  - Execute the request, perhaps with a mention of HttpUriRequest used
- for the design consideration, perhaps instead of talking about error handling, we can talk about the OO design that we use to create a EndpoingCaller -&gt; Request etc. I feel that the design you created is quite extensible and follows OO fashion well, so perhaps we can highlight that. If sticking to error handling, perhaps can include the description of how the exceptions are escalated and handled at various levels.

Hi, btw I think I just discovered a possible bug. When the category statistics window is opened, and I typed exit in the command box to exit, the app closes but the graph window is still open. This is not consistent with the behavior of the help window. i.e. the help window will close automatically if the app exits.

I am slightly concerned about having Model extend ScheduleModel in terms of design, but I understand why it's done this way for abstraction and to maintain compatibility. If there is no better solution then it LGTM. Perhaps in a future PR we can abstract the different model interfaces out (for tutor, appointment, etc) and then have Model extend all of them for consistency.

While I really appreciate the creation of the new class `AppointmentBook` and the other changes, I must warn against these kinds of monolithic PRs. At the current moment there are too many changes to look through and accept, and I am unsure how some of these changes will affect other aspects of the code. I worry that with the amount of changes made we may be unable to fix all the test cases by this week's deadline.

But should be ok, can merge this PR and fix it later 

The main idea/use cases
1. User filter by c/Honda+
Means that filter by car brand "honda" only
2. User filter by c/+Sedan
Means that filter by car type "sedan" only
3. User filter by c/Honda+Sedan
Means filter by Honda Sedan, means just customer who prefer only honda doesn't pass the filter

Should we implement it like this (i.e. delete the passengers at index until we hit one with a pool, ignore the rest)? Perhaps a better implementation is to delete all that don't have a pool then error at the end. Also, I think it would be more intuitive if we printed the deleted passengers names rather than size.

This method is used to ensure we don't create a "duplicate" pool, so if we checked for passenger equality, the same driver could potentially be driving 2 pools at the same time as long as the passengers were different.

I move this line to note of command and delete it in addCommand. It only means, you cannot give an invalid format for the optional field, just because it is optional. Otherwise, some may think since it is optional, the MB will ignore the wrong format and proceed with the rest of the command.

> 1. Personally, i would have more 'one-time' tasks than recurring tasks if im using a a task manager. E.g. we would only have 1 _assignment 1_ in a module. So for recurring tasks, realistically speaking, it should be made into a command rather than just a normal field like 'workload' for example. This is also a justification we can give for the criticism on 'why does _recur_ have to be a command on it's own' if we get it?
> 2. With regards to your 1st problem, I am not quite sure as to why the book will stop updating weekly? If a task is recurring weekly, it will refresh the deadline every week regardless, no? Might need some clarification there haha sorry
> 3. The second scenario is actually a v important consideration. One possible implementation can be when a user marks task as _done_, we can update the deadline (and remove starttime maybe), so that the user can see the next deadline already? what do you think? Another possible solution would be to maybe add a _next deadline:_ field in the task card which is way simpler i think?
> 
> For the refresh command, i think it is a bit unsafe to add a new command with only a day left because I think quite a few changes would need to be made? and we only have (only a day at most) to implemement the feature? I am scared that it will be too tight for v1.3 deadline?
> 
> Overall, I am still fine with either though cuz for me, both ways work fine and (i think) either way can be justified hahaha

For 1, I think your justification is also valid, maybe need a vote?
For 2, let's say you added a task whose deadline is 2021-4-1, recurs daily, and then you close the software. After two months, you open the software again, it will become 2021-4-2. But if you do not enter any command and close the software straight away, the storage will not be updated, it is still 2021-4-1.

Yes, this will not work, and it is supposed to be that way. This follows the "add" command, where location "bed **_(lots of whitespaces)_** room" is considered a different location from "bed room". Hence, when I clear items in location "bed **_(lots of whitespaces)_** room", items in location "bed room" will not be deleted.

LGTM but having a separate method like:
```java
public static Flashcard[] getDatabaseOfFlashcards(int numberOfQuestions) {
    return Arrays.copyOfRange(getDatabaseOfFlashcards(), 0, numberofQuestions);

is nicer as my pending PR has many tests related to this method so I would imagine there would be lesser conflicts if you have the above instead. Thanks!!!

This is the dummy history data generation part. Since (now the `Score` handles the `LocalDatetime` which is the `Score's` creation time internally) && (The precision of `LocalDatetime` is only limited to seconds in our application), a consecutive creation of `Score` object will result in duplicate `Score` objects stored (which, by the same principle of how we store `Flashcard`s, will throw an exception).

When the data is no longer dummy, we can safely assume the user would at least take 1 second between finishing the current quiz and finishing the next quiz.

If the above is not a legitimate assumption, I can change my implementations (but some efforts are required).

It is essentially because
```java
int index = -1;
        if (isShowingHistory) {
            index = flashcardListPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().indexOf(flashcardListPanel.getRoot());
            if (index != -1) {
                flashcardListPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().set(index, scoreHistoryListPanel.getRoot());
            }
        }
```
the
```java
indexOf(...)
```
method would return `-1` if the object to look for is not in the `List`.

Thus a static variable seems not very ok but I kind of cannot think of any elegant solution to it...(?:grimacing:)

I think we might need another `dateTime` variable here because from what I see, the tutee can only edit either the `timeFrom` or `timeTo`. If we update one of them, the another's value will be overridden due to how `updatedTimeFrom` and `updatedTimeTo` is instantiated. Maybe @kingsleykuan can double confirm on this? Thanks! The rest of the codes LGTM!

You have used the Enum correctly! Just a small recommendation, sorry I kind of forget how secondary school grading works, but maybe the Enum can accepts values such as "A1", "A2" to make it as close to the real world context?

Do either of the following
1. Sort the collection again in the test case and compare element by element
2. Use the string comparator to compare every element with its subsequent element in a for loop

The test is to check lexicographical. 
1. If the add command is renamed and no command starts with A, this test fails incorrectly.
2. If the add command remains but the list is [add, find, alias, edit, delete], this test passes incorrectly.

You seem to have misunderstood my approach. This is not testing the sorting order of your `getAutocompleteCommands`. This is testing the sorting order of the `Collections.sort` function.

What you should be doing is
1. get a completely clean list of command unrelated to your autocomplete command.
2. Sort that list of commands as per your expected sorting order `Collections.sort(cleanlist)`
3. Iterate through this clean sorted list and compare against your test list

This existing test will fail to achieve its purpose when
1. `logic.getAutocompleteCommand("")` returns [add, clear, alias, find, delete]
2. `Collections.sort` sorts it into the correct order
3. asserts verify that its the correct order.
4. Note that the command actually returned a bad order but all the asserts passed.

Issue closed because this should not be in UG, the user does not really need to know this. NUS has many international students and we cannot assume ALL of them have a Singapore number. As such, overseas numbers should be accepted as well so we cannot restrict it to 8 digits. If this is seen as a bug in actual PE, we will explain as above.

um, i dont get why this is so? why just check objects for equality, same information should have same object. I think you should add another field like numberplate if you are worried about collisions. What you can do is if there is no explicit numberplate then just assign a random number to the numberplate (best random number is just the current timestamp in nanoseconds).

Yes, it is intended to be in the format of `delete-patient --force INDEX`, which is indicated in `FORCE_DELETE_MESSAGE_USAGE`. Will edit the javadocs so that it's clearer.

Yes I think it might not need to be in the `try` block, will edit later. The reason why I wrote `isForceDelete` is to avoid the possibility of `isForceDelete` being not instantialized. Another way is shifting the try block inside the first if statement, which may be a little ugly, almost arrowhead style. What are your thoughts?

The reason why I do it this way is so that if the index is wrong for `delete-patient --force notAnIndex`, the parseException will be raised as well. I will add in an invalid index message before the message usage to improve on the clarity of the exception.

I guess this is a problem since we mentioned that:
"Parameters can be in any order.
e.g. if the command format specifies n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER, p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME is also acceptable."
Would it be better if we say parameters with prefixes e.g. `n/` can be in any order to avoid confusion?

> It seems weird to me that `next()` for `Completion` returns a `Completion`?

Since it implements `Status` it needs to have a `next()`, and `Completion` shouldn't lead to any new statuses anyway, so I guess it's fine to return itself? Creating new objects at a terminal step may lead to some undesirable side effects. By checking if `.next()` returns the same object it can even be used to check if something is calling `.next()` on a `Completion`.

Thanks for the comment! To clarify, the VALID_[VARIABLE] constants are not used as replacements for user input but rather for the personbuilder and other such utility functions during testing. As for tests concerning user inputs, the constants declared below of the form [VARIABLE]_DESC_BOB, and as they are supposed to emulate user inputs, they are of the String datatype.

This is pretty inefficient I guess, can change to utilise a Set.

`edit 0` has been handled to throw "Index must be a non-zero positive integer". However `edit 99` will appropriately throw "at least one field to edit must be provided" because the command did not follow specified format. Once user adds at least one parameter to edit, then invalid index error will be displayed.

Hmmm.. I don't think its needed since we are just letting the user knows that even though they can't edit matric number through the edit command... But our app will still approve if they edit the matric number directly from the JSON file ... So if they tried to file a bug saying that our UG state that user's matriculation number cannot be edit yet it can be edited through the JSON file then we can refer them to this line.

Yup, I meant to say that the UI will still reflect the new matric number if you edit the matric number field directly from the JSON file. Would "VAX@NUS will reflect the new matriculation number if it is edited directly from the JSON file. " be clearer?

Hmm... I understand your concern...  But I think the problem stems from the unmodifiable matric number field. 

The JSON file allows every field to be edited but the edit command disallow the matric number to be edited.. 

I'm not really sure how the user will think if we specified that matriculation number cannot be edited in the edit command section... If they read and think that matric number is unmodifiable throughout the app... Then they might think that there is a functionality bug when it comes to the JSON file since it allows the user to edit the matric number....

Would writing it down to inform the users that they can edit the matric number in JSON contradict with our edit command behavior? Technically, edit command and JSON are separate areas...

 The expected behavior for your given scenario is that VAX@NUS will start up with an empty student book. There are validation checks in place to check that the matriculation number for the appointment belongs to a valid student record containing the corresponding matric number. If the validation fails, VAX@NUS will start up with an empty student book.

Making matriculation numbers uneditable seems to be a better option... As a student only has one matriculation number throughout their study in NUS, there is no need for our users to edit their matriculation field. However, if the user add a student with an incorrect matric number that he/she has to delete the particular record before adding a new student record.

@rjeez 
Thanks for finding bugs for us, we really appreciate it a lot.

However, for this bug, this is the intended behaviour.

add `n/hello` `desc/yes add`  `n/bye` `desc/no`

If there is parameter of the same type it will take the last occurrence which is `n/bye` for Name and  `desc/no` for Description.

it's not a search-by-name, as the findreader functions searches the keywords independently. Read the UG.

For example, "findreader Amy Bob" will list all the readers "Amy", "Bob", and "Amy Bob".

Thank you for pointing out!
Can i keep it for now? because it separates from the functions used by add-appt. 
In the future if there will be some changes, i can change it easily without breaking the code for add-appt.
In the finalised version, if they are the same, i will rename them. 
It has the flow of : hasEditConflictingAppointment -&gt; hasEditAppointment -&gt; editContains 
Otherwise the flow would be: hasConflictingAppointment -&gt; hasAppointment -&gt; editContains.

But note that these changes are essential for us to have the objects be testable. Or else, you can't instantiate a ID with some particular fields without changing the underlying counter. Previously, unlike CustomerId; OrderId and CheeseId are instantiated with native constructor, with no way of not incrementing the underlying counter.

Now the issue is the workflow works for push events, but not from the pr from forked, because GitHub doesn't expose secrets to forked-triggered workflows. Seems like we have to close this one down, as our current workflow, we are not pushing/pr-ing from master repository's branches, the notifier doesn't work in this case.

There is one class of ModelStub with no useful methods, and the rest of variations are extending from it and overiding methods important for testing. We could make it abstract though. What else do you think we can do. The idea is we have two kind of test suites: 1 with using the actual ModelManager and 1 using just the stubs.

Test cases seems to make it hard for you to pass in a LocalDate as an argument. I changed the validation to use #41 `dateUtil`. Should we still make it as a LocalDate field?

The rest of the other 'with' methods doesn't do their parsing in this testutil though. I think what I'm going to do is,

1. Allow birthday to accept a string and parse the string. This is primarily for testing.
2. Create an overloaded constructor which directly accepts a LocalDate.  This is what the app will be using.

add-debt and subtract-debt both have almost the exact same implementation in terms of both commands and parsers. Implementing them separately seems inefficient. Implementing them via the ChangeDebtParser and ChangeDebtCommand and passing a boolean increases code reusability.

The debt class is to store debt within a Person. We can have negative debt to indicate the person owing money to the user instead.

The ParserUtil.parseDebt is used to parse debt passed into the ChangeDebtCommand, while Debt.isValidDebt is used to validate Debt.  I will change parseDebt to parsePositiveDebt for clarity.

The reason for implementing this way is that the user would normally change the debt amount indirectly through adding/subtracting unlike the other fields that would be edited directly using `edit`.

Hence the Parser requires a different method to parse **positive** debt amount rather than the default valid debt.

Ordering is sorted in ascending order of the last used date by design.
Selecting a piece of clothing will update its last used date to the current date, which is then sorted to the bottom.

Not a bug, as it is clearly stated in the UG how each feature expects price to be written. For commands such as add, price is written with a 'p/' as it needs to be clearly specified that it is a price to correctly create an entry. For find/findall commands, prefixes such as 'n/' , 'p/' are not used to make the commands easier and more intuitive to type out (eg: find $6).

Special characters are not accepted as inputs, as it would negatively impact the rest of the fields as well. However, I agree that the UG should mention this feature is meant for easy copying into recipient fields (such as the `To` field in emails), in which case special characters would not be very useful as separators.

Thanks for the feedback. The take here is that the speed improvement is not based on the list of food and their associated macronutrients, but with the recording of food on a longer-term scale with the use of CLI-based inputs as opposed to a GUI one (it's possible to copy-paste values and inputs for multiple days, as opposed to doing meal-by-meal interacting using GUI).

The issue is actually in the feature listing, as opposed to in the quick start as mentioned. In addition, this is also because you will need to clear the sample data on first launch before you are able to input your own data. We'll make this clearer in the UG and the application.

Hello,

We've made this clearer by displaying the Food name together with the duplicate count should there be an existing duplicate food name.
</panel>

<panel  header="**12 :octicon-comment:** (other comment)" popup-url="https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/issues/164#issuecomment-814693856" expanded>

Actually, the user guide already mentions that for duplicate food names for a given date, they will be appended with a duplicate count - much like how MacOS and Microsoft Windows does it for duplicate file names. So this is an intended behaviour.

Using a count column for each food name will not work, as different food intake may hold different nutrient values.

The one in address/logic/commands is an {abstract} class and exists in a different package from this Command.java. 

I think since they are clearly differentiable by file path, it shouldn't be an issue. Because alias/Command.java is named as such logically.

This test was originally to ensure the commands are sorted. Under the assumption the "add" command will always be present, regardless, the first command at index 0 should always start with a.

I get your drift.

It was my mistake to include the Collections.sort() again right after calling the method. It is already called in getAutocompleteCommand(). 

I have implemented your suggestion 2 as per your previous comment. I am using the comparator method so the hard-coding of commands is minimized.

right now to change the mode of display we are hiding and showing the flashcard panel using setVisibility(boolean) method of javaFX. but I think this mode class will come into handy next time when we want to say parse different commands based on the current type of mode (quiz or learn), ie. commands specific to quiz or learn mode

Hi, that's a great query. However we have decided to leave this feature for future implementations and as of the current version, by managing flashcards we mean adding tags and removing tags from flashcards. We will clarify this further in the user guide. Thanks!

It is meant to be in this way. delete_task/event + an index out of bound and delete_task/event + an index that is not a positive integer are treated as two different types of invalid inputs. The former one is indicating that this index might be correct given sufficient tasks/events in the list, while the latter one is indicating that the index itself is meaningless.

Hmmm I don't think it's a documentation bug. I think I need to make it clearer that if the School Residence field is left blank, it will default to DOES_NOT_LIVE_ON_CAMPUS. Then maybe in the filter/stats command we can also specify that DOES_NOT_LIVE_ON_CAMPUS is a valid input. 

But @SiTingST, I believe that `filter DOES_NOT_LIVE_ON_CAMPUS` should not return nothing?

@picasdan9 @SiTingST I like the idea of using boolean values, since it is unambiguous and yet keep the command format intact.

In fact I think using 0 and 1 would be the best. This is to prevent ambiguity regarding the capitalization of the boolean values e.g. `true vs True`. We are already using enum for this, so it should be quite similar

for the MESSAGE_NON_EXISTENT_APPOINTMENT, can we mention explicitly that there is no appointment found? So I would word it as " "Found student with matriculation number %s \n" + "However, no appointment was found in the records." I think this would reduce ambiguity greatly. 


Other than that, looks great!

The reason for this error could be because you did not change any nutrients values, which is an intended behavior of the update function. We will update the user guide to be more clear on this and the error message. As what @sjq-sohjunqi mentioned, we have also set a 2dp limit for nutrient values to prevent such use case of many decimal points.

Hmm I think the root of the issue stems from your `addFinancialRecord` in `BudgetBabyModelManager`. The condition always return `false`. 

Maybe you can try this and see if the issue still persist?

> Hi, btw I think I just discovered a possible bug. When the category statistics window is opened, and I typed exit in the command box to exit, the app closes but the graph window is still open. This is not consistent with the behavior of the help window. i.e. the help window will close automatically if the app exits.

@eksinyue @natosy I think we just need to set the upper bound of `getPastMonthStatistics()` to be the current month.
I believe `getPastMonths()` will be called, which eventually limits the number of "past months" to 6.

~~Just need to edit UG saying that if a command does not expect parameters, it will just execute the first command.
eg: 
`list exit` will call list
`exit list` will call exit~~

Edit: calling `list` in another tab other than `Home` tab should prompt the user to go to the `Home` tab first, before executing list.

(Also good to note down in UG that commands that do not expect parameters will just execute the command regardless of what comes after the command)

Thanks for informing us of the above.

We have updated our UG to reflect that the actual prefix should be ph/ instead of p/

The reason you see the error above is because there is no prefix ph/ in your command. This causes the application to read "John Doe p/98765432" as the name of the contact. This is not permissible as our name only allows alphanumeric characters and spaces, and not '/'.

1. As a CS student who does tasks near deadlines, I want to know which task is coming the soonest, so that I can finish it first.
2. As a CS student who has recurring tasks every period of time (e.g. weekly, monthly, etc), I want to add the task and set a recurring time, so that I don't need to add the same task multiple times.
3. As a CS student, I want to have notes for each task, so that I remember important information about the task
4. As a CS student, I want to sort deadlines from each module, so I can estimate how much workload needed for each module
5. As a CS student, I want to put multiple tasks instantly, so that I don't need to submit multiple times
6. As a CS student, I want my reminders to show the module code and name
7. As a CS student, I want to move the reminders easily, so that if the deadline change I can change the reminder easily
8. As a CS student, I want to know how many deadlines I have and how many deadlines I have done, so I can know whether I am lacking behind or not
9. As a CS student, I want to have the email of the prof or ta of the module, so that I can contact them if I have an issue with a deadline
10. As a CS student who just finished a holiday, I want to reset my calendar, so that I can start a new semester with new deadlines

Ok! I've gone with both suggestions:
- Deleted Regex class to use an enum in `TimeslotParser` class
- Merged both date and time for the non-next commands but of course means there are twice as many enum variables now, but beats creating another enum class just for time.

Hmm aites! I changed it to use matcher instead, and to catch exceptions with a boolean `isInvalidTime` to differentiate the messages likein seb's PR.

But I only created one format with the time -&gt; meaning user has to key in the time and will not be able to leave it empty. Unless I add another conditional for the inputs without time and repeat the `matching for dates` alone, and create another help method to cut short the matching for date. What do yall prefer! 

```
try {
            LocalDateTime currentDateTime = LocalDateTime.now().withSecond(0).withNano(0);
            LocalDateTime parsedDate = null;

            if (nextDateTimeMatcher.matches()) {
                final String nextTimePeriod = nextDateTimeMatcher.group("nextTimePeriod");
                final String timeInput = nextDateTimeMatcher.group("timeInput").trim();

                // need to repeat matching of dates again, because both are separated and process differently for the next command
                if (Arrays.stream(Day.values()).anyMatch(e -&gt; e.name().equals(nextTimePeriod))) {
                    parsedDate = currentDateTime.with(TemporalAdjusters.next(DayOfWeek.valueOf(nextTimePeriod)));
                } else if (nextTimePeriod.contains("MONTH")) {
                    parsedDate = currentDateTime.plusMonths(1);
                } else if (nextTimePeriod.contains("YEAR")) {
                    parsedDate = currentDateTime.plusYears(1);
                } else {
                    isInvalidTime = true;
                }

                int[] hoursMinutesArray = parseTime(timeInput);
                parsedDate = parsedDate.withHour(hoursMinutesArray[0]);
                parsedDate = parsedDate.withMinute(hoursMinutesArray[1]);
                parsedDate = parsedDate.withSecond(0).withNano(0);

hi im facing some issue with this!

currently, if i input **without timing**:
```
add-appt pt/5 dr/dr. pluto at/next month dur/1H 30M t/flu t/covid
```

there will be a `NullPointerException` and `InvocationTargetException (checked)`. I tried to catch both in the `parseNextDateTime` and `removeMeridian` method but no avail... the former says that `InvocationTargetException` is never thrown too? have yall encountered such an issue before :")

user input is wrong, should be `edit-appt 1 pt/4 dur/ 1H 00M`, i can help standardize in UG.

but hmm even if the correct input I still get a `NoSuchElementException` not sure why... does the `EditAppointmentCommand` handles a `dur/` prefix? Or do you think it's a problem with the timeslot parser

Not wrong date! `edit-appt` will make changes due to the `pt/1`, hence datetime remains the same. No invalid message comes up cux patient has be edited. 

Should the `editAppointmentDescriptor` check against every field and existing prefix? if not every valid and non-valid command combo will have the same error

also not sure if severity is high, cux it works the way it should, where at least one of the optional fields have been filled.

We disagree with the recommendation as including the Insurance Plan within the Client UI may result in the UI becoming too "wordy", especially if the client has many Insurance Plans. Instead, we will explore showing the number of Insurance Plans a client has within the Client UI, though this feature will be postponed to a later version of the app.

8. As a CS student, I can mark assignments that I have finished as completed so that it lets me feel a sense of accomplishment.

For example if delete/edit person -&gt; we need to remove/edit from connections

> I like the colour change, but it doesn't seem like the issue has been resolved. I think what users expect is that the suggestions isn't selected unless arrow keys or tab is used to trigger the selection, then without those keypresses, the enter key will work for the command box directly, so commands like `list` and `exit` only need to press once without dismissing the suggestions.

ok currently i got the tags to show up for these commands, but i realised that the only relevant tag for these commands is the method tag; the other tags do not make sense to be included since no api is actually called, so there is no data to be shown in those tags unless we want to actually run it like the show command.

sorry yk what do you mean by this, it was bc yt accidentally put 1 instead of 2 (its by right supposed to be 2), but bc it was a failure test it still can pass the checks, so i j changed it for her!! but all the other testing functions use ...1 and ...2 if there are multiple programs involved!!

It's is implemented that way, to ensure that if you mistakenly mark a delivery as done, then it can be unmarked. So, it is not a functionality bug, but a deliberate extension to the feature to make things easy for the user.

Hi, for 2 you get both because both entries have the same telephone number, and the find command allows you to search by multiple attributes for the same command, so you were effectively searching for entries named Mark as well as entries with the stated phone number. For 1, so far we return matches only if the keyword completely matches an entry, so partial keyword will not yield results. However, we will look into this to see if we keep it the way it is based on the requirements of our app.

The issue here is that the date is validated using Java's localDate which allows taking in the dates specified above. Now, for the first date included, the date looks wrong but is actually valid. Adding a range for appropriate years might sound good, but may actually reduce the functionality of our app. Java's localDate also allows taking in negative years given that it allows entering date in two eras. For the time being, the advice would be to refrain from entering negative years.

I think this part is causing some bugs. Coz from there's no execute() in editOwnerCommand and editProgramCommand. So this execute() should inherit from editDogCommand as well since it already inherited the editEntityCommand.

Remove! Yea, I totally understand, Anli has told that during the meeting. As you can see from my latest commits, I have pushed only small PRs. And also I push this long PR since #281 has already been approved last time. Coz I thought you won't review it anymore as it is exactly the same thing. 
Hope you can understand. I apologise for doing this.

Um, I know how Pawbook works lol. Instead of explaining how the function work, can you specify which part the error is caused? I tried adding dogId to new owner and remove dogId from the old owner before I pushed the latest commit here but it doesn't work as well. I'll push the one I did which follows the approach u mentioned here, but it has some assertion error which highlights that the owner to remove dog id doesn't have that dog id. Maybe, you can have a look at it.

> I think some of my feedback for the previous attempt at writing test still stands, like the typical addressbook ideally should be combined as one since there's no benefit to having 3 that's hard to maintain, I do see some effort made to refactor some tests, but some generics are not written correctly. Furthermore, I think while most of the edit implementation can be attributed to you, kindly exclude the edit program ones as you initially only implemented edit owner and edit dog partially.

Do you mean combining the TypicalDogs, TypicalOwners and TypicalPrograms into TypicalAddressBook?
