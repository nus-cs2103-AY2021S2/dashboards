Appreciate your finding on this, however, i do not believe that there is a bug regarding this as the stock of B should be 30 initially. When you added the orders for GZY and GEE, the 10 and 20 stock are then removed respectively from the inventory. Therefore, after you typed 'items list' after adding the orders, the inventory shows stock of 0 for B. In conclusion, both orders can still be fulfilled. Maybe we can improve by better indicating that the inventory count is excluding the stock assigned to the orders

Could it be possible that this is not an 'alt' box?

FridgeFriend runs the command regardless whether is an exception or not (unless invalid input, which can be mentioned, or perhaps simply put this as 'valid command' instead of 'successful execution')

So, I think if the 'alt's command is a successful execution, the logical opposite is an unsuccessful execution, in which case it affects the output but not the initial execution of the command.

"No more than one alternative partitions be executed in an alt frame. That is, it is acceptable for none of the alternative partitions to be executed but it is not acceptable for multiple partitions to be executed." (https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s2.github.io/website/schedule/week10/topics.html#w10-1-sequence-diagrams-basics)

Therefore I recommend either this condition be changed to "valid command" instead of "successful execution", or the alt box moved downward to capture execute() of Command rather than getCommand() of Parser.

Dear @stephlewyh ,

Thank you for your comments!

Regarding point 11, I intentionally made the "Saving data" portion under "Manual testing" verbose, to insure against cheeky testers who attempt to break our code by testing all sorts of invalid corrupted test files, then reporting them as bugs. Since data files have the widest margin for mischief, I believed that having all possibilities spelled out would prevent them from reporting known issues as "bugs". 

Is my assumption wrong? Is there a better way to write the section while keeping in mind adversarial readers/testers?

Thank you very much!

Same concern for 7), even though the section is lengthy, it is clear and comprehensive, while not compromising on readability as some people who may be more interested in the Exceptions might find it useful (even though most might skim it). Clarity seems to be important here as there might be some weaker/confused readers who might find fault with sections that are not as clear/fleshed out.

Is there any way to improve the section while not compromising on detail/clarity for more nitpicky readers/might raise (invalid) "bugs" over content that is summarized instead of detailed?

This is actually designed in this way. Once a goal is set, it will check the progress via existing records immediately. That's why the newly added daily goal will be seen as achieved since there are records for today already. Therefore, this is not considered as a bug.

We avoided using a while loop because we anticipated that if the user changed his/her mind halfway and no longer wanted to edit the lesson, they would not be stuck endlessly being prompted for a valid input.

Now it will print lesson type + exactly 1 detail in this order of availability: day and time, link, staff name, staff email
If there are no details yet, does not print any additional detail.

I think it should be fine to allow future dates, in case the user's computer time isn't set properly.

Change all tests to use `assertDoesNotThrow` instead of a try catch block.

Additional minor changes:
- Remove hardcoded whitespace from error messages
- Change `BaseException.toString()` to be compatible with the new error format
- Add `MethodDoesNotExist` exception to be caught in the `Parser.parse()` method, for `*Command` classes that do not have the correct constructor
- Small changes to error messages

Probably you would like to use Singapore time format instead of the default ISO one for both printing and parsing.
```java
protected static String datePattern = "dd/MM/yyyy";

LocalDate date = LocalDate.parse(dateString, DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(datePattern));
System.out.println(date.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(datePattern));

Usage is `record [DATE] [/s SYMPTOM] [/d DIAGNOSIS] [/p PRESCRIPTION]` (specified in UG)

For T0012345, the checksum is A. So `T0012345A` is valid, but `T0012345C` is not. It says invalid because IT IS INVALID. That is basically a non-existing ID number.

For our current design, only the "meaningful" part of the command is used. For `current` command, since it does not require a payload/any arguments, everything behind the command itself will be ignored.

We use the last digit ("checksum digit") to verify the validity of the IC numbers. For T1234567, it should be `T1234567J`. Similarly, there is no IC numbers starting with `e`, so it is an invalid number.

@brandonfoong Yes. I understand that. However, I think the suggestion not allowing future dates sounds reasonable that's why I added it. That should largely be a typo if it occurs. For the computer clock problem, I think it is minor and users probably will want to ensure their computer clock being accurate before use our program.

It will be problem if there is a long list of patients with similar ID (e.g. they were born in the same year). It will also not be computationally efficient to do a O(n) search for all items for each and every `load` executed. We understand this is a good suggestion but it would be implemented.

Hm you have a point there about consistency, we did consider it at first but then we realized that we have quite a few other 4 letter commands (exit, list, close - 5 letter) which did not need to be shortened as they were already short enough, plus keeping the full word where possible might improve the understandability?

For add lesson, there is no integer involved in the command. We are handling inputs as strings.

For other parts of our program:
"The int type in Java can be used to represent any whole number from -2147483648 to 2147483647"

And under the 3.8 of the UG, we also stated that the features are named and highlighted in mark up. Below are some screenshots for your reference.

I am thinking that the tags is up to the recipient to set themselves and the tag is not linked to the emails. An example is like teachers may tag an email as work and send it to students but for the students they will tag it as school.

I see that this implementation only sets the answers, if assignment.getAnswers() == null. Maybe you could consider changing it so that we set the answers every time the answers are loaded from text file? This way the answers will update in case the text file was changed.

I appreciate your concerns for the inappropriateness of deleting reviews. However, it is necessary to control the input of reviews, so that we can prevent potential issues such as unrealistic and inappropriate reviews.

Thank you for your suggestion. We have taken note of this issue and decided to allow showing the progress of MCs more than the course requirements (eg. 160 MCs) as it is stated [here](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UG_FAQ-1-1.pdf) that MCs more than 160 will still be computed towards your CAP.

Thank you for your comment. The CAP should be calculated even when the total MCs exceeded 160 MCs based on the NUS CAP calculation method [here](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UG_FAQ-1-1.pdf).

Thank you for raising this issue. My team and I think that it is better to implement a new "info" feature for viewing the details of a module (including prerequisites) rather than listing all under the "list" feature which could be too cramped.

Yes, we do not have unique IDs for each record, relying solely on the list entry index.
We plan to keep it this way as this is still a viable for this iteration.
Deleting an above entry will reduce the index of all entries below naturally, so we will not identify it as a bug.

> The items add command of this version of easyLog is consistent with its orders add command. Specifically, the user needs to input item price and item command in 1 line. Also, the user will be prompted again and again if a pair of valid item price and stock is not given. The coding style is also improved.

We believe that having a return function in every section of the UG helps to ensure that even if our user only wants to refer to a single section, they are able to see the commands in a coherently displayed manner, with none of the available commands missing.

The command is designed to fit all flags in a single command specifically for fast typists, who can quickly add a new module in a single line. The suggestion has been extensively discussed previously and the conclusion was that having multiple prompts would not benefit fast typists and other users, as they need to constantly pause and await system response.

Great job in improving the parser class to separate out all the parameters from the user input. I like how you declared the length of certain separators and commands as final variables.

However, a concern I have with this implementation is that the module code has to be a parameter for every single command. Would it be easier to select a module we are working in so all the actions performed are done in the context of that module? It would also reduce the number of unnecessary parameters for each command!
